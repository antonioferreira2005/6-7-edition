SUMMARY, FORMULATION, RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Ms. ___ neuropsychological testing performance demonstrated
significant impairments in most aspects of assessed cognitive
domains, most notably including disorientation and impaired
control of information in working memory.  These findings 
suggest
that she is experiencing effects of a partially resolved
delirium, though problems with construction and confrontation
naming suggests an underlying, more stable cognitive disorder
(likely mild dementia or MCI).  Her ability to make well 
informed
decisions at present is compromised.  To the extent that these
findings reflect a delirium, with resolution she is likely to
experience some improvement in cognitive functioning. 

Recommendations:
1.Given Ms. ___ current difficulties with word finding, she
is encouraged to "talk around words" (i.e. circumlocute) in an
effort to allow her to verbally express herself.  She may 
benefit
from assistance with learning how to do this.

2.Ms. ___ should follow up with her behavioral health team to
continue treatment of her bipolar illness, particularly in the
context of her reported plans to move.

3. Follow up neuropsychological testing is recommended once her
mental status has stabilized.

Findings attached.
