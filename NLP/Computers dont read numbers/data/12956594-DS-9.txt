STUDIES:
___ CT Abd/Pelvis - 
1. Acute sigmoid diverticulitis, with small-to-moderate amount 
of free fluid within the pelvis, without evidence of a drainable 
fluid collection. 
2. Hypodense masses within the right lobe of the liver and dome 
could 
represent early developing abscesses, though without 
organization to be 
drainable. These are incompletely characterized on this 
monophasic study.  
If clinically stable, follow-up with an MRI in ___ days should 
be performed. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with history of diverticulitis and hypertension was 
admitted with sigmoid diverticulitis. 

1. Sigmoid Diverticulitis 
Patient's CT abd revealed acute sigmoid diverticulitis, which is 
consistent with patient's history and exam. Her subacute 
symptoms over the last month however are somewhat more puzzling. 
Infection or malignancy are possible. 
- continue IV cipro / flagyl
- prn zofran for antiemetics and morphine for pain control
- NPO with IVF
- advance diet as tolerated
- send stool studies 
- follow-up blood cultures
- would likely benefit from colonoscopy as an outpatient; she 
reports having had two colonoscopies in the past but she cannot 
remember why. 
- check lactate in the AM

2. Liver Lesions
Etiology is unclear, would likely benefit from outpatient 
follow-up. 
- outpatient follow-up

3. Benign Hypertension: Stable
- continue beta blocker

4. Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Stable
- husband to bring CPAP on ___

# FEN: NPO with IVF; replete electrolytes prn 
# PPx: heparin SC
# CODE: presumed FULL CODE

# ___: pending further improvement in pain and symptoms 

Patient's PCP was contacted by email to alert him of admission. 

In addition to the above summary per the primary medical team, 
the patient was admitted to the surgical service for management 
of her diverticulitis. She was kept NPO until her abdominal pain 
was completely resolved at which point she was advanced to a 
general diet. Her pain resolved, she was afebrile and she had no 
leukocytosis throughout her admission, and so was discharged to 
home with plan to follow up in the clinic to readdress her 
surgical options, which were explained to the patient during her 
admission. 

In regards to her identified liver lesions, the patient had a CT 
that showed two hypodense lesions. These were reexamined using 
an MRI, which was determined to be consistent with hemangiomas, 
and so they would not require acute management.
