Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F with hx of renal transplant with worsening vaginal 
discharge, dysuria and suprapubic pain. Positive UTI.

# Suprapubic pain - resolved, likely from UTI, will continue to 
monitor. Pt comfortable and ambulating without difficulties.  
.  
# ARF - Cr 2.4, stable since yesterday (2.9 on presentation). 
Renal transplant following. Having good urine output. Excpect it 
to continue to improve. Will monitor as inpatient until Cr 
normalized, or at least below 2.1.  Patient was discharge with 
Cr of 2.4 with close follow up. 
.  
# UTI - urine dip positive on admission - pyuria from UTI v. 
contamination from vaginal infection. Still unsure, 2 cultures 
are negative. Received ceftriaxone x2 days, then lost IV access. 
Doxycycline will cover. Complete 5 day course.  
.  
# Vaginal discharge - seems to be chronic problem. Improving. 
Consistent with cervicitis secondary to yeast, althoug OSH test 
neg for yeast. Want to complete ___ecause 
she is clinically improving.  Outside hospital tests were 
negative for yeast, bacterial infection or trichomonas.  
Gonorrhea and chlamydia negative, too.  Unsure of etiology, 
although patient thinks fluconazole is helping.  
.  
# ID - treating yeast infection and UTI, cultures all negative. 
Pt has been afebrile and showing no signs of systemic infection. 
Will continue with doxycyline and fluconazole for now. Continue 
to monitor.  
.  
# Immunesuppression - on prednisone, sirolimus, and cellcept. 
Continue pred 5 mg daily, cellcept 500 mg bid (decreased due to 
interactions with abx) and sirolimus 1 gm daily after level is 
checked. Will continue daily level checks.  
.  
#  Patient discharged home feeling much better.  Suprapubic pain 
resolved and ambulating well.  CT and ultrasound were negative.  
Still think pain may be from UTI vs. vaginal yeast infection.  
Creatinine improved with fluids.  Think patient was not drinking

renal transplant team and return to hosiptal if pain returns.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for suprapubic pain, dysuria and vaginal 
discharge.  We were worried that the pain may have been related 
to your transplanted kidney, so we did an ultrasound and CT scan 
that were negative for problems with your kidney.
.
We think you had a urine infection and a yeast infection, 
although we do not have any positive cultures.  We are treating 
you with doxycycline and fluconazole for these infections.  You 
will finish a 7 day course of each.  The end date is ___.
.
These antibiotics can interact with your sirolimus and cellcept 
levels.  We were following them while you were in the hospital.  
Please follow the list of medications closely.  You will need to 
follow up with your nephrologist next week by ___ to have 
your levels rechecked.
.
We also followed your creatinine to see how your kidney function 
was doing.  It was 2.9 on admission and stable at 2.4 on 
discharge.  We think it was higher than normal because you 
hadn't been drinking and were dehydrated.  You probably were 
trying to not drink too much because it hurt to pee.
.
Please return to the hospital with any more pain with urinating, 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, fever or chills.  Or any 
other concerns.  Call ___ if an emergency.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
