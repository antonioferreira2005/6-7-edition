SUMMARY/ASSESSMENT: ___ female with history IDDM poorly 
controlled and gastroparesis with recurrent flares presents with
acute on chronic abdominal pain consistent with prior episodes 
of
gastroparesis, found to have hyperlactatemia of unclear 
etiology. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:

#Hyperlactatemia: Despite IVF resuscitation, trending upward to 
5.3 in the ED. Of unclear etiology. Hemodynamically stable. No 
concerning findings on CT A/P suggestive of bowel ischemia. CXR, 
urine unremarkable. Thoroughly reviewed medication list to 
explain a possibility of type-B lactic acidosis though no 
culprits found. No evidence of liver disease. Utox negative. 
- Continue to trend lactate
- Discuss additional w/u if no improvement 
- Serial abdominal exams 
- IVF PRN 
- Treatment of presumed intra-abdominal infection w/ zosyn, low 
threshold to discontinue 
- if worsening diarrhea, can send stool studies/c.diff
- F/u pending BCx, uCx 

#Acute on chronic abdominal pain
#Gastroparesis flare: Similar pain to prior flares with diarrhea 
and vomiting. Trial the patient's typical inpatient regimen, 
avoid narcotics due to effect of reduced GI motility. 
- Tramadol 50 q4 prn per usual tx regimen
- Tylenol ___ mg Q6H 
- reglan/Zofran use cautiously given QTc > 500. 
- GI cocktail, omeprazole PRN 
- ADAT, maintenance IVF if off meds 
- Consider palliative care consult for symptomatic treatment 
given recurrent admission 

___: Cr up to 1.2, baseline 1.0-1.1. Likely prerenal. 
- Continue to trend 

# Anxiety 
- Ativan BID:PRN 

# DM2 complicated by neuropathy and gastroparesis.
- Continue home lantus of 40 units, HISS 
- ___ need insulin teaching, ___ consult since uncontrolled

- hold lisinopril iso ___, resume when able

# Chronic neutrophilic-predominant leukocytosis
# Chronic thrombocytosis
# Iron deficiency anemia: Evaluated by heme/onc during prior 
admission. Thought to be chronic stress response w/ leukomoid 
reaction, reactive thrombocytosis. Transfused with IV iron 
repletion during last hospitalization given GI symptoms and 
inability to tolerate PO. 
 - Continue to trend
 - Consider IV iron transfusion prior to discharge
