IMAGING/STUDIES
===============
___ RUQ US
1. Findings concerning for cavernous transformation of the main 
portal vein.  
Multiphasic CT of the liver is recommended for further 
evaluation.  Patent 
hepatic artery. 
2. Echogenic and nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis.  
Sequelae of portal 
hypertension including splenomegaly and moderate volume ascites. 

3. Gallbladder-wall thickening likely due to liver disease. 

___ ___ US
Lack of visualization of the left peroneal veins.  Otherwise, no 
evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity veins. 

___ Triphasic CT
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhotic liver with sequelae of portal hypertension, 
including splenomegaly and varices.  No focal hepatic lesion.
2. Patent portal vasculature.  No evidence of cavernous 
transformation of the portal vein.
3. Distended stomach.  Diffuse dilatation of small bowel loops 
in the imaged abdomen, measuring up to 4 cm.  Mild dilatation of 
the transverse colon. The lower abdomen and pelvis are not 
included on this study.  Findings could represent ileus or 
obstruction.
4. Moderate intra-abdominal ascites.

___ KUB
Interval placement of NG tube projecting over proximal stomach.  

Redemonstration of diffusely dilated small and large bowel loops 
consistent with ileus.

___ TTE
IMPRESSION: Likely very small atrial septal defect/patent 
foramen ovale. Normal left
ventricular wall thickness and biventricular cavity sizes and 
regional/global biventricular systolic function. No valvular 
pathology or pathologic flow identified. High normal pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure.

==============
This is a ___ year old gentleman with a history of alcohol use 
history with recently diagnosed EtOH cirrhosis, COPD and 
enlarged prostate who presented to an OSH with abdominal pain 
and confusion. He was admitted to the ICU for asymptomatic 
hyponatremia, which improved with fluid restriction and albumin. 
He was called out of the ICU, but was quickly transferred back 
to the ICU due to new hematemesis requiring elective intubation 
and urgent upper endoscopy, which revealed duodenal ulcers, one 
of which was oozing and was treated with epinephrine injection. 
He was transferred out of the ICU, but again needed to be 
transferred back to the ICU on ___ due to hypoxemia 
requiring NRB and tachycardia to the 130s c/f aspiration 
pneumonia iso fever, started on broad spectrum antibiotics. He 
had also developed an ileus requiring NGT to suction and rapidly 
progressing renal failure concerning for HRS. On ___ a 
family meeting was held at bedside with wife ___, 
___, daughter, and step-son, primary and palliative care teams. 
We discussed how Mr. ___ multiple complications are all 
secondary to his cirrhosis and that this process is not 
reversible (not a transplant candidate given ongoing alcohol 
use). It was decided with the patient and his family that we 
would pursue hospice placement. His code status was changed to 
DNR/DNI, no escalation of care, no ICU readmission. The patient 
expressed that he wants to maximize the quality time he has to 
spend with family in hospice, and towards this goal, only 
uncomfortable meds and therapies (i.e. NGT, octreotide 
injections) were stopped.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES  
======================  
#HYPONATREMIA
Patient was noted to have a newly depressed Na to 119 on 
presentation. Persistently in one-teens so admitted to MICU for 
close monitoring. He received 50 g of 25% albumin. His Na 
uptrended to 121 on ___, and improved on serial rechecks to 
123->124. He was called out to the ___ service, 
continued to improve until other issues as above.

#ACUTE ETOH INTOXICATION
#ETOH USE DISORDER
Serum EtOH level of 44 on admission. Per collateral from wife, 
pt continued EtOH use despite multiple recent hospitalizations. 
Monitored on CIWA score, SW consulted, however above acute 
issues took precedence.

#RASH
Presented with new petechial rash concerning for small vessel 
vasculitis. Workup was notable for: hepatitis serologies 
negative, tTG-IgA 28, ANCA negative, normal complement levels. 
Improved during hospitalization.

#LEUKOCYTOSIS
Presented with leukocytois with neutrophilic predominance, no 
specific localizing symptoms. Received one dose of Vanc/Zosyn at 
OSH. As noted elsewhere, intermittently on antibiotics for SBP 
prophylaxis or HAP coverage, stopped in accordance with GOC.

#DECOMPENSATED ETOH CIRRHOSIS
