Chest film ___
The patient is status post median sternotomy with aortic valve 
replacement. Lungs lungs are low. Small bilateral layering 
pleural effusions are unchanged with new presence of fluid 
layering within the minor fissure. The upper lung fields

Brief Hospital Course:
Plavix was discontinued and ___ underwent preoperative 
testing and evaluation. Blood bank sample was notable for cold 
agglutinins. Preoperative echocardiogram demonstrated normal 
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved regional and global 
biventricular systolic function. There was mild aortic valve 
stenosis. She remained hemodynamically stable. She was noted to 
have acute blood loss anemia which required transfusion of blood 
products. Her examination was notable for a right groin 
hematoma. On ___, she developed brisk bleeding from the site 
that did not resolve after 1.5 hours of direct pressure. The 
vascular surgery team was consulted and she was taken to the 
operating room for  right femoral artery repair and hematoma 
evacuation with placement ___ drain. She tolerated the 
procedure and was transferred back to the CCU for further care. 

On ___ she experienced chest pain overnight that resolved 
within 10 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin. Her EKG 
demonstrated ST depressions in 1, AVL, consistent with ischemia. 
She was treated with antibiotics preoperatively for a urinary 
tract infection. 

Mrs. ___ was taken to the operating room on ___ and 
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 (left internal 
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery,saphenous vein 
graft to distal right coronary artery,obtuse marginal artery and 
the diagonal artery/ Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous 
vein/ Aortic valve replacement with a size 23 mm ___ 
___ tissue valve) with ___. Please see operative note 
for full surgical details. She tolerated the procedure well and 
was transferred to the ___ for invasive monitoring and 
recovery. She weaned off of pressor support. She awoke 
neurologically intact and weaned to extubate. 
Beta-blocker/Statin/ASA and diuresis were initiated. POD#1 she 
went into rapid atrial fibrillation and was bolused with 
Amiodarone and placed on a drip per protocol. Chest tubes and 
pacing wires were discontinued per protocol without incident. 
She remained in the CVICU until pod#4 for a tenuous  respiratory 
status. She was aggressively diuresed and her pulmonary status 
improved. She transferred to the step down unit for further 
recovery. She continued to slowly progress and by the time of 
POD 13 she was ambulating with assistance, wounds healing, and 
pain controlled. She was cleared for discharge to ___ 
___. All follow up appointments were advised.
