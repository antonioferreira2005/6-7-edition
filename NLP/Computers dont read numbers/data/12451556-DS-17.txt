Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
chronic cholecystitis
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___:
Laproscopic to open Cholecystectomy

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ has been through an
extensive workup, which indicates that he may in fact have
chronic cholecystitis rather than gallbladder carcinoma.  Mr.
___ underwent a right upper quadrant ultrasound after our
visit in late ___, which demonstrated a contracted gallbladder
with gallstones and no obvious mass.  A subsequent endoscopic
ultrasound by Dr. ___ a ___
pancreas without peripancreatic adenopathy.  The gallbladder had
thickened walls and the potential for a polypoid mass, which
could not be biopsied without perforating the gallbladder.  His
serum CEA and CA ___ are within normal limits.

Mr. ___ underwent extensive cardiology workup by Dr. ___. 
He has no evidence of pulmonary hypertension, and his ejection
fraction is 35%.  A stress test demonstrated no reversible
ischemia.

Mr. ___ underwent volumetric measurements of his liver.  The
left hepatic lobe constitutes 32% as the future liver remnant.

Since our last visit together, Mr. ___ has been feeling well. 

He has had absolutely no abdominal pain or change in his
appetite.  In retrospect, he had one episode of significant 
right
upper quadrant pain associated with fever, which has 
subsequently
resolved completely.  We repeated a CT scan of the abdomen and
pelvis today, which I reviewed personally.  The gallbladder is
thickened with surrounding inflammatory changes, which abut the
second portion of the duodenum.  The right hepatic artery is
close by the infundibulum.  There is no clear evidence of
invasion of the liver parenchyma.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for 
evaluation and treatment.  On ___, the patient underwent 
open cholecystectomy, which went well without complication 
(reader referred to the Operative Note for details). After a 
brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the 
floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, and dilaudid PCA 
for pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.
Neuro: On POD1 the patient received dilaudid PCA with good 
effect and adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake 
(POD2), the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Patient's 
Eliquis was held throughout hospital course and restarted on 
discharge.  
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well 
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, 
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were 
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection. Patients wound was 
evaluated and clean/dry/intact. 
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout 
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.
