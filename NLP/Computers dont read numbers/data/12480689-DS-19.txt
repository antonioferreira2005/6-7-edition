___ labs-
TSH 0.01, T4 6.7, FT4 8.21
.
CXR ___

Nodular opacity projecting over the lower lung fields, 
symmetrically
bilaterally, are likely due to nipple shadows; this can be 
confirmed with
repeat with nipple markers. Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary 
process.

CXR ___

New small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent opacities 
likely
atelectasis

EKG ___
Sinus tachycardia. Baseline artifact. Early R wave transition in 
the
precordial leads, probably a normal variant. No previous tracing 
available for
comparison.

___ CXR 
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2.  Improving tiny bilateral pleural effusions.

___ CT ABD/PELVIS
1.  No abscess, no definite adenopathy on this abdominal/pelvic 
examination.

___ CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST
1.  Enlarged thyroid gland with two nodules in the lower pole of 
the left lobe
and isthmus.  These can be further evaluated via ultrasound if 
indicated.
2.  No evidence of infection in the chest.

Blood, urine, stool cultures negative

___ 6:46 pm STOOL     CONSISTENCY: NOT APPLICABLE
      Source: Stool. 

   VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO VIRUS ISOLATED.

Respiratory viral screen negative
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o female with h.o Graves disease who presents with fever, 
cough, diarrhea, found to have neutropenia. 

# Neutropenic fever: Due to methimazole , possibly worsened by a 
concomitant viral infection. CXR, CT abd/pelvis and chest were 
wnl and all cultures remained negative. Diarrhea and cough 
self-resolved. She was treated with Vancomycin and Cefepime 
while neutropenic, however switched to vanc/aztreonam when she 
developed a rash after about a week of treatment, with 
subsequent resolution of the rash.  Given that she remained 
afebrile, she was swtiched to oral levofloxacin/clindamycin.  
Methimazole was stopped and patient's counts slowly improved. 
___ was over 1300 on day of discharge, and trending up. She will 
complete one more day of clinda/levofloxacin, with repeat CBC in 
one week to ensure counts have fully recovered (CBC to be 
followed up by Dr. ___ ___ hematology). Patient counseled 
to monitor for any fever, and will contact her PCP if fever 
develops.

# Grave's disease-last TFTs ___ ___ TSH but appropriate 
Ft4 (see ___.
Methimazole and propranolol were initially stopped in the 
setting of her febrile neutropenia and borderline low blood 
pressures. Her endocrinologist was notified of her admission and 
recommended close follow up on discharge for alternative 
treatment, likely radioactive iodine. Propranolol was restarted 
for sinus tachycardia and symptoms of graves prior to discharge, 
at 10 mg TID.

# Anemia- Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic 
disease; more acute drop likely secondary to bone marrow 
suppression. Repeat CBC in one week as an outpatient.
