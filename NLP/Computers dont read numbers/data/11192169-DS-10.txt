Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with weakness and abdominal 
pain in the setting of recent colonoscopy concerning for colon 
cancer. You were admitted to the ICU for low blood pressures and 
concern for infection. Once you stabilized and there was no 
further concern for an infection, your antibiotics were stopped 
and you were transferred to the oncology service for further 
care. On the floor, you met with the oncology team and social 
work to help arrange hospice services. 

You are written to continue home medications such as allopurinol 
and Lasix, as well as written for new medications including 
tamsulosin. You do not need to take any medications that you do 
not wish to take. You may also take medications just as needed, 
such as Lasix for swelling, allopurinol as needed for gout pain, 
and tamsulosin as needed for inability to urinate.

You are now safe for discharge from the hospital with services. 
It was a pleasure caring for you - we wish you all the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Oncology Team
