Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a ___ yo RH male with ___ prior stroke and mild residual 
R-sided weakness, TIAs, HTN, s/p prostate CA, who presents with 
new onset right sided "heaviness". Symptoms noticed on waking up 
yesterday morning. However, did not experience much difficuty 
ambulating and able to go to by bus to casino and play. The 
heaviness persisted, prompting hospital visit. On exam, patient 
has mild R-NLF flattening, RUE levitation, normal strength b/l 
but reduced FFM on right. Speech at baseline per daughter and 
patient. Found to have new small cortical infarct involving left 
posterior frontal parietal lobe and tight L ICA at bifurcation 
on carotid doppler U/S (70-79% stenosis). Patient declined any 
surgical intervention including endovascular stenting. We held 
his antihypertensives to allow BPs to autoreg to SBP 200. His 
blood pressure has been on the low side and given that he has a 
tight carotid with recent stroke so we have held his Diovan and 
Norvasc. He will follow-up with Dr. ___ week and have his 
BP rechecked and reassess resuming his meds. 
Because his stroke occurred on Plavix, we have switched him to 
Aggrenox (tolerated this well in hospital without headache) and 
ASA (we elected the 81 mg dose rather than 325 given that he 
reports some prior bleed though no further info available after 
talking to PCP and daughter), as well we have started him on 
Simvastatin 40 Qday (AST/ALT nml). Hgb stable 11.5; reports 
recent normal colonoscopy. HbA1C 5.9%.

He also was found to have a UTI with Gram neg rods, final 
speciation and sensitivities pending. His Creat was elevated at 
1.8 and BUN 42 so he should have that followed. His troponins 
were mildly elevated 0.07, CPK 266, but his ECG and telemetry 
were unchanged. Cardiac Echo showed dilated LA, mild symmetric 
LVH, hyperdynamic EF 75%, otherwise nml. He should continue 
Bactrim to complete a 7-day course, we will call him if the 
final culture grows an organism resistant to this. He was 
cleared by ___ to be discharged home without services.

Discharge Instructions:
You have had a small stroke due to narrowing of the blood vessel 
in your neck supplying the left side of your brain. An open 
surgery or intravascular stent was offered as possible treatment 
for this, but you declined these operations.
Because this occurred while on Plavix, you have been switched to 
a different medication called Aggrenox which you should take as 
precribed (it can cause mild headache at the beginning) and you 
should also take a daily baby aspirin along with this.
Your blood pressure has been on the low side so we have held 
your blood pressure medications Diovan and Norvasc. Please 
readress this when you see Dr. ___ week and have your 
blood pressure rechecked. Your kidney function was also abnormal 
so please follow this with Dr. ___.
Your heart enzymes were mildly elevated in your blood but your 
electrocardiograms were unchanged and there was no heart rhythm 
abnormality on telemetry recording. You had an ultrasound of 
your heart which showed some thickening of the left-sided 
chamber but otherwise normal.

Please call your primary care doctor or return to the Emergency 
Department for any worsening of your symptoms or new concerning 
symptoms for example weakness, numbness, headache, dizziness, 
problems with your vision, pain on urinating or incontinence.

You also have a urine infection for which you should complete 
the prescribed course of antibiotics.
