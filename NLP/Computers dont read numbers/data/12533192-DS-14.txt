Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old gentleman re-admitted to the acute care service with 
bleeding from the laparoscopic cholecystectomy incision.  He was 
discharged 48 hours ago on coumadin with a lovenox bridge.  Upon 
admission, the patient was made NPO, given intravenous fluids, 
and had blood work drawn. He was reported to be tachycardic and 
the vital signs were closely monitored.  Staples were removed 
and a hematoma was evacuated. No focal area of bleeding was 
identified.  Diffuse oozing from
the fascial bed was noted, and the wound was packed tightly with 
sterile gauze.
Blood  word was drawn which showed an INR of 4.4 and the patient 
was given 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma.  His vital sign were 
closely monitored and serial hematocrits were cycled.  

Upon admission to the surgical floor, the patient reported chest 
pain and was given SL nitroglycerin with resolution of the chest 
pain.  An EKG was done which did not demonstrate any ischemic 
changes.  He was tachycardic and given 5 mg of intravenous 
metroprolol with a decrease in the heart rate.  Because of these 
findings, cardiac enzymes were monitored with an inital finding 
of 0.04.  The troponins were cycled and peaked at .12. Since the 
patient was asymptomatic, the troponin cycling was discontinued. 
Cardiology recommmended XL metoprolol upon discharge. 

The patient resumed a regular diet and his vital signs 
stabilized.  Anticoagulation was held and the ___ was closely 
monitored.  The coumadin was resumed when his INR was <2.0 and 
the lovenox was discontinued.

The patient was discharged from the hospital on HD #5  with an 
INR of 1.3 and instructed to return to his daily dose of 
coumadin with careful monitoring of his INR. Vital signs were 
stable upon discharge with a hematocrit of   Follow-up visits 
were arranged with the acute care service and the primary care 
provider.  ___ services were contacted for monitoring of the 
___ and coumadin dosing.

surgeon has said its okay.
