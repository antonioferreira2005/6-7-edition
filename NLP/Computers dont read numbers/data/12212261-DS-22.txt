History of Present Illness:
___ w/ h/o HTN, hypothyroidism, and Alzheimer's disease s/p 
unwitnessed fall this morning in bathroom. Patient lives in an 
assisted living facility where she has regular care providers, 
and has had gradual deterioration of her cognitive function over 
the past year- no longer recognizes her daughter at times, has 
trouble dressing herself and at times eats inappropriate objects 
(purell, oil, vinegar). She spent the day prior to admission 
with her family where per her daughter she was behaving at her 
baseline. The daughter notes the patient complained of a little 
bit of leg pain that resolved prior to her going to sleep. She 
was found by one of her care givers in the morning on the floor 
in the bathroom, awake and alert per report. The patient has no 
recollection of the event but is a limited historian ___ her 
dementia. Daughter wonders if the patient was exhausted from her 
Christmas celebation and fell in that setting. Per report, no 
fevers, chills, no CP, SOB, palpitations. Appetite has been good 
and patient has been compliant w/ medications. Last fall was 
over one year ago. No h/o syncope or seizures. Uses walker 
consistently and has not been noted to be more unsteady. Has 
care assistants who stay with her all night and a couple days a 
week.  
 
In the ED, initial vital signs were T 98.8 P 77 BP 156/65 R 22 
O2 97% on RA. On exam, patient was oriented only to herself. 
Patient c/o pain everywhere, but especially in b/l hips. Patient 
underwent FAST scan which was negative, notable only for a large 
anterior pericardial fat pad. Also underwent CT torso, CT 
C-spine, CT head and plain films of her hips which were all 
negative for acute process or fracture. Labs were notable for 
creatinine at baseline of 1.3, normal coags, and UA w/ few 
bacteria, 1 WBC, neg nitrite and neg ___. EKG was w/o ischemic 
changes but did show first degree heart block. She is being 
admitted to medicine for syncope work up. VS on transfer: T 97.8 
HR63 BP 163/74 RR22 98% on 2L.  
 
On the floor, patient is pleasant and oriented to her self. She 
denies any pain, but on exam, reports difficulty moving her R 
leg.

STUDIES:
========
CT HEAD: No acute intracranial process.

Hip XR: Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern. Bowel gas and bowel 
contents obscure the bony detail of the sacrum. Incompletely 
evaluated is degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine. 
Mild SI joint degenerative changes. Intact pubic symphysis. 
Bilateral hip joint space narrowing, more on the right. No 
dislocations. No fractures identified. Degenerative changes of 
the bilateral  
knees.  
 
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for fracture. Please see CT 
torso from later today for further details.  

EKG: Sinus at 77 bpm. Normal axis. 1st degree AV block. <___epression and TWI in V2 (new), old TWI in III, otherwise 
similar to prior. Qtc 411.  

CXR ___: In comparison with study of ___, there is no 
evidence of 
pneumothorax.  Although no rib fracture is seen, if this is a 
serious clinical concern, oblique views could be obtained.  
There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, 
accentuated by the lordotic position of the patient. No vascular 
congestion or acute focal pneumonia.

CXR ___
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are 
lower lung 
volumes.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette 
without appreciable 
vascular congestion.  The discordancy raises a possibility of 
cardiomyopathy 
or pericardial effusion. 
  
No definite evidence of acute pneumonia.  However, a lateral 
view would be of 
value if the condition of the patient permits, in order to 
assess for 
retrocardiac consolidation. 

___ CT Torso:
CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is a subcentimeter 
nodule within the right lobe of thyroid gland (102:2). No 
supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy 
is identified. The thoracic aorta is non-aneurysmal and 
demonstrates no signs of traumatic injury on this venous phase 
study. No central pulmonary embolism is identified. Mild ectasia 
of the right pulmonary artery may be due to underlying pulmonary 
hypertension. There is no mediastinal hematoma. Moderate 
cardiomegaly is noted, however, there is no pericardial 
effusion. Mild coronary atherosclerotic calcifications are 
noted. There are dense mitral annular calcifications.  
 
The tracheobronchial tree is patent to subsegmental levels 
without bronchial wall thickening or bronchiectasis. There is 
bibasilar atelectasis but no confluent consolidation or pleural 
effusion. No suspicious pulmonary nodules are identified. There 
is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  
 
CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is a minimal 
residual hiatal hernia, significantly improved compared to prior 
examination. The liver demonstrates homogeneous parenchymal 
enhancement without suspicious focal lesion. The hepatic veins 
and portal venous system are grossly patent. No intra- or 
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified. The 
gallbladder, spleen, and adrenal glands appear normal. A coarse 
calcification adjacent to the splenic hilum may be a small 
granuloma or a calcified splenic artery aneurysm. There is fatty 
atrophy of the pancreas which is otherwise unremarkable. 
Multiple hypodense lesions throughout both kidneys are simple 
cysts and others remain too small to characterize. The largest 
is located within the interpolar region of the left kidney and 
measures 3.0 x 3.4 cm. No perinephric fluid collection or renal 
laceration is identified. There is no abdominal free fluid or 
free air. The abdominal aorta and its branch vessels demonstrate 
severe atherosclerotic calcifications though are non-aneurysmal 
and grossly patent. Stomach and small bowel loops are normal in 
caliber and  
configuration without evidence of obstruction or inflammation. 
No  
pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph 
nodes are identified.  
 
CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are scattered colonic 
diverticuli though no signs of acute diverticulitis. A Foley 
catheter and a small amount of air is seen within a decompressed 
bladder. No pelvic free fluid is identified. The uterus and 
adnexa are not visualized likely secondary to prior surgical 
resection. No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph 
nodes are identified.  
 
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There is a moderate fat-containing 
ventral hernia (102:82). There is no fracture or bone 
destructive lesion. Multilevel degenerative changes of the spine 
are noted with moderate levoscoliosis and degenerative changes 
most severe at T12-L1 and L1-L2.  
 
IMPRESSION:  
No traumatic pathology within the chest, abdomen or pelvis.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE.
=====================
___ year old lady with history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, 
and advanced Alzheimer's dementia who presented from home after 
a fall. She was found to have UTI with klebsiella as well as 
bronchitis. She was sent home with 24 hour care.

ACTIVE ISSUES.
==============
# Unwitnessed Fall: Unclear if this was a mechanical fall vs. 
syncope as it was unwitnessed and patient has no recollection of 
event secondary to her underlying dementia. No history of prior 
syncope or seizure and her last fall was over ___ year ago. Per 
her daughter, she has been steady walking with walker and was 
without infectious symptoms. Syncope differential includes 
orthostasis, arrhythmia (new prolonged PR interval on EKG), 
hypothyroidism. Infectious workup on admission was negative, 
though she did have some evidence of mild bronchitis.  Extensive 
imaging with CT was also unrevealing. She did have a low grade 
temperature, and given her second urine culture while in house 
grew klebsiella, she was treated with antibiotics (see below). 
Acute MI highly unlikely given no new ischemic changes on EKG 
nor chest pain. Telemetry was unrevealing, though she did have 
new prolonged PR interval. B12 wnl. TSH was mildly elevated, but 
lower than in past few readings.
- Overall her fall could have been multifactorial, due to 
infectious processes, deconditioning, and progressive dementia.

#UTI: Recent urinalysis in house was suggestive of UTI 
(leukocytes, WBCs, and many bacteria). Urine culture grew 
klebsiella sensitive to levofloxacin. Her UTI may have been 
caused by instrumentation of the GU tract in the setting of 
chronic severe urinary retention.
- She was discharged on a short course of levofloxacin (5 days).

# Mild Bronchitis: On admission, she had an oxygen requirement 
of 2L. She was not on oxygen at home. She improved to high ___ 
on room air. Chest imaging showed no evidence of pulmonary edema 
or pneumonia (though no lateral film was obtained). Exam and 
clinical picture are consistent with bronchitis. She was started 
on a 5 day course of levofloxacin to cover for this. She was 
also treated with albuterol nebulizers.

# Hypertension: Hypertensive on arrival, but she had not taken 
home anti-hypertensives. 
- Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide was stopped given her acute 
kidney injury. She was continued on metoprolol and doxazosin, 
and was started on amlodipine. 

# Hypothyroidism: History of recently elevated TSH (7.1 in ___ 
with normal T4. Now w/ TSH of 4.8, improved, but still high. 
Unlikely to be etiology of fall. 
- continue home synthroid for now
- free T4 WNL, high TSH was mild

# Hyponatremia: Short-lived, resolved. ___ have been 
hypervolemic given new crackles on lung exam. Improved with 
diuresis.

# Urinary retention: She has a history of severe asymptomatic 
urinary retention with PVRs as great as ___ mL. No history 
of incontinence and does void at times, likely overflow, but 
straight caths 4x/week at home per Dr. ___ recommendations. 
She had a foley catheter briefly twice in house given her 
urinary retention. She was also straight cathed. At home, she 
should straight cath daily. UTI was treated as above.

# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Resolving by the time of 
discharge, likely due to over-diuresis (she was given IV 
furosemide, which caused her creatinine to bump). As creatinine 
was improving after down-titration of diuretics, further work-up 
___ due to urinary retention was not deemed necessary.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
# Alzheimer's dementia: In house she was very pleasant, without 
evidenceof agitation. She has severe Alzheimer's disease, seen 
by cognitive neurology in ___ and scored ___ on MMS. At that 
time, she was noted to have continued deterioration with poor 
recognition of her daughter, more problems with ADLs and "will 
sometimes make mistakes such as putting toothpaste on her cheeks 
or using lipstick on her eyebrows." Per Neurology note, she is 
already on maximal medical therapy and management at this time 
may be directed by geriatrics. If there is further progression, 
placement in a Alzheimer's unit may be considered.
She was continued on her home memantine and donepezil. She was 
frequently re-oriented, and tethers were minimized as much as 
possible. Her home care attendant stayed with her 24 hours. She 
was also treated with a moderate bowel regimen and pain was 
treated appropriately. 

# Venous stasis: She has chronic skin changes, but no evidence 
of skin breakdown exam. She reported pain at the site of creases 
in her ___ stockings, which improved with massage and frequent 
re-positioning of the stockings. 

# Chronic kidney disease: This may be secondary to long history 
of hypertension. Please see discussion of kidney injury above.

# Chronic pain: She was continued on her home acetaminophen, 
oxycontin, and oxycodone.
