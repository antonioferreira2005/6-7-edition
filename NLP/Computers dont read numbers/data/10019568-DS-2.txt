admitted to the TSICU for continuous oxygen saturation 
monitoring, pain control, CIWA, serial chest xrays, and close 
respiratory monitoring/pulmonary toilet. Acute Pain Service was 
consulted and an epidural was placed for pain management. 

ON HD1, the patient self-discontinued her chest tube. A 
post-pull cxr did not reveal any new or increasing pneumothorax.

to oral pain medication. The patient was hemodynamically stable 
and transferred out of the TSICU to the floor. On HD3  Physical 
therapy evaluated the patient and felt she was safe to return 
home without any services.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ after sustaining injuries from a 
fall. You you fractured your fractured multiple ribs on the left 
side and injured your lung, requiring a chest tube be placed. 
You were admitted for pain control, close respiratory 
monitoring, and chest tube management. The chest tube has been 
removed and your pain is under control with oral analgesia. Your 
vital signs are stable, and you are medically cleared for 
discharge home to continue your recovery. Please note the 
following discharge instructions: 

* Your injury caused rib fractures which can cause severe pain 
and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of 
the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily (e.g Colace and/or 
Senna) and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible. If 
you do not have a bowel movement in the next couple of days, you 
can take a laxative such as Milk of Magnesia or Miralax as 
needed. 
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

It was a pleasure taking care of you
