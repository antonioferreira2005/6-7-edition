IMAGING:

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:  Scarring in the left lung at the level of the 
extensive left rib cage deformity.  Overall, findings are stable 
and no acute findings to account for patient's complaint 
hemoptysis. 

CHEST CT ___:
IMPRESSION:  
1) No findings to account for the patient's hemoptysis including 
no evidence 
of endobronchial lesion. 
2) Dilated pulmonary arteries suggestive of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension. 
3) Small hiatal hernia. 
4) Multiple, displaced, chronic left sided rib fractures with 
adjacent 
atelectasis.   
5) Moderate aortic valvular calcification. 
6) Marked atherosclerotic disease involving the ostia of the 
major mesenteric 
arteries within the upper abdomen. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old non-smoking gentleman with a PMH of 
CAD s/p CABG (SVG x3 to PDA, OM and LIMA to LAD) in ___ on 
aspirin and Plavix, HTN, HFpEF, complete heart block s/p PPM, 
and h/o several episodes of mild epistaxis since starting Plavix 
admitted for evaluation of single episode of presumed 
hemoptysis, found to have evidence of recent epistaxis.
  
# Epistaxis: Patient was initially admitted for evaluation of 
presumed hemoptysis. He had a single episode of 
coughing/spitting up ~3 tablespoons of blood. Upon furthur 
history, he did note several episodes of epistaxis in the past 
year since starting Plavix. He also has an exam consistent with 
aortic stenosis, which can predispose to mucosal AVMs and 
bleeding. Chest CT was unrevealing. Patient noted that the night 
prior to episode of "hemoptysis" that he had the sensation of 
blood dripping in the back of his throat. Physical exam revealed 
a significant amount of dried blood in the left nares, as well 
as small amount of fresh blood with no evidence of active 
bleeding. He had no furthur episodes of hemoptysis or epistaxis 
during his admission. His history and physical are most 
consistent with epistaxis causing blood to accumulate in the 
oropharynx, leading to patient coughing/spitting a small amount 
of blood. Normal chest CT also makes true hemoptysis less 
likely. He was discharged in stable condition with presumptive 
diagnosis of epistaxis, NOT hemoptysis.

# CAD: s/p CABG in ___. Stable, without any chest pain at 
present. EKG v-paced indeterminate for ischemic changes. 
continued aspirin, plavix, and rosuvastatin given HD stability 
and stable HCT. 
  
# HFpEF: Likely secondary to ongoing HTN. Last TTE in ___ 
showed LV EF 60% with mild symmetric LVH. Patient's exam 
significant for crescendo-decrescendo murmur radiating to b/l 
carotids, suggestive of aortic stenosis; however, this has yet 
to be documented by TTE. He did not have any signs or symptoms 
of heart failure during this admission. 

# Hypothyroidism: Well-controlled. Continued levothyroxine.  

# Depression: With history of catatonic features. continued 
venlafaxine and ritalin (fractionated per our forumlary)  

# OSA: Has not used CPAP for several years. Declined CPAP.  

# HTN: SBPs were consistently in the 170s during admission. 
Patient states that this is typical for him and he has not been 
on any antihypertensive meds. We wanted to start an 
antihypertensive regimen, but patient declined. He was made 
aware of the risks of untreated hypertension, including 
worsening CHF, stroke, and death. He acknowledged these risks 
and opted to discuss this furthur in close followup with his 
PCP.

==============================================================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
#HTN - Untreated with SBPs in the 170s. He was made aware of the 
risks of untreated hypertension, including worsening CHF, 
stroke, and death. He acknowledged these risks and opted to 
discuss this furthur in close followup with his PCP.

#? aortic stenosis on exam: Last TTE was in ___ showing only 
diastolic dysfunction. Patient may benefit from repeat ECHO to 
assess for aortic stenosis. Currently asymptomatic, without 
chest pain, syncope, or DOE.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for evaluation of coughing blood. You 
had a CAT scan of your lungs, which was normal. You had dried 
blood in your nose. It is likely that you had a nose bleed, 
which bled into your mouth, causing you to spit out blood. You 
should follow up with the interventional pulmonologists.
Also, you had very high blood pressure during this admission. We 
recommended that you start medication to lower your blood 
pressure, but you declined. We explained that having 
uncontrolled blood pressure can lead to heart disease, stroke, 
and death. You stated that you understood these risks and will 
followup with your PCP to decided whether or not to start blood 
pressure medications.

It was a pleasure taking part in your care and we wish you a 
speedy recovery!
