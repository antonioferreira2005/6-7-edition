Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
___ yo with malignant fibrous histiosarcoma of right hip bone 
admitted for C1 CDDP/adriamycin.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ PICC placement.
___ Upper endoscopy (EGD).
___ Kidney biopsy.
___ Colonoscopy.

 
History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ gentleman who was in his usual state 
ofhealth until a few weeks ago when he started developing a 
significant right hip pain.  At the same time, he had decreased 
appetite and significant weight loss (65 pounds) within a short 
period of time.  He was also describing having night sweats for 
the last three to four months, weakness and fatigue.
.
The patient initially was evaluated for his right hip pain and 
it was felt that is due to arthritis and so he had a trial of 
prednisone without improvement of his symptoms and so an MRI of 
the hip was obtained on ___ that revealed a large right sided 
necrotizing mass with adjacent abnormal bone marrow signal 
within the right hemipelvis, which was concerning for sarcoma.  
He also had a chest CT on ___ that revealed a solitary 
triangular right upper lobe solid pulmonary nodule measuring up 
to 7 mm.  On ___, he underwent CT-guided biopsy of the 
right hip lesion that confirmed malignant fibrous histiosarcoma 
of the bone. He was discharged to rehab from his most recent 
hospitalization when he was diagnosed with his sarcoma and also 
found to have a hospital acquired pneumonia and noted to have a 
right apical lung mass of 7 mm. He returns from rehab for his 
first cycle of chemotherapy. On ROS he endorses constipation and 
ongoing right hip pain with movement, he is relatively 
comfortable at rest. He denies fevers, sweats, chills, cough. He 
Denies fever,  headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, 
sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal 
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,  BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, 
dysuria, hematuria. all other ROS are negative.

.
___ pCXR: Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with 
cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta. Low lung volumes are unchanged. 
New bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, are likely 
atelectasis. New left perihilar opacities are most likely due to 
pneumonia, given the clinical symptoms of fever. There is no 
pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.
.
___ Bedside swallowing study: pt presented with a functional 
swallowing mechanism without overt s/sx of aspiration. Based on 
today's evaluation, pt appears safe to continue on PO diet of 
regular consistency solids and thin liquids. Silent aspiration 
cannot be r/o at bedside.
.
___ CTA: IMPRESSION: Moderate cardiac enlargement is 
generalized, a moderate pericardial effusion is stable since 
___.
1. Nondiagnostic CT pulmonary angiogram. While a pulmonary 
embolism is not identified, this study is not adequate for its 
exclusion.
2. Multifocal consolidation in the dependent portions of the 
lungs. This is nonspecific but likely due to recurrent 
aspiration pneumonia.
3. Bilateral hilar and subcarinal adenopathy, which has 
increased in size since ___. This is nonspecific but most 
likely hyperplastic.
4. Increasing right upper lobe solid 8-mm nodule, concerning for 
metastasis.
5. Incidental findings of a stable soft tissue nodule that 
indenting the posterior upper trachea (11:5) since ___, 
which could represent a lymph node or a submucosal esophageal 
lesion such as a leiomyoma (11:5). This could be evaluated 
endoscopically if clinically appropriate.
.
___ ECHO: IMPRESSION: LVEF >55%.  Trivial pericardial 
effusion. Biatrial enlargment. Normal left ventricular cavity 
size and wall thickness with preserved global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. Mild tricuspid regurgitation. 
Mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
___ CXR PORTABLE: There is interval progression of 
multifocal opacities in the lung bases but slight improvement in 
the left perihilar opacity. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is 
unchanged. No pneumothorax is seen. Small amount of pleural 
effusion cannot be entirely excluded. The right PICC line tip is 
at the level of low SVC.
.
___ CXR: In comparison with the study of ___, there has 
been some improvement in the areas of consolidation at the 
bases. However, there is a dense triangular region in the 
retrocardiac region that suggests substantial volume loss in the 
left lower lobe.
.
___ RENAL U/S: IMPRESSION: No findings to explain the 
patient's acute renal failure.  Bilateral renal cysts as 
identified on recent CT.
.
___ CT ABDOMEN: IMPRESSION:
1. Increase in size of osteosarcoma of the hip.
2. No hydronephrosis or other explanation for acute renal 
failure.
.
___ DOPPLER U/S BILAT LEGS: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT 
seen in bilateral lower extremity veins.
.
___ COLONOSCOPY: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, 
abnormal mucosa (telangiectasias) in the distal rectum 
consistent with radiation proctitis, otherwise normal 
colonoscopy to cecum.

they felt he was not a candidate for surgical repair.  He 
completed XRT to right hip sarcoma ___.  Nephrology was 
consulted for progressive acute renal failure.  Muddy brown 
casts in urine consistent with ATN, but no clear cause.  Urine 
eos consistent with AIN; PPI changed to H2 blocker.  Kidney 
biopsy ___ prelim result is ATN.  Colonoscopy ___ showed 
telangiectasias in the distal rectum consistent with radiation 
proctitis.  He started cycle #1 ___ with infusional 
doxorubicin x2d which he tolerated well and was discharged to 
rehab.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or 
wheelchair.
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted from rehabilitation for chemotherapy for your 
hip sarcoma.  However, you were not able to receive chemotherapy 
 immediately because an IV line needed to be placed on admission 
and the following day you developed a high fever.  The fever was 
due to pneumonia and IV antibiotics were started.  A swallow 
study looking for aspiraton (swallowing down the wind pipe) was 
negative.  Pulmonary was consulted because the fever persisted.  
You were seen by Gastroenterology as well for gastrointestinal 
bleeding and worsening anemia that needed a blood transfusion.  
The gastroenterologists performed endoscopy looking into your 
esophagus and stomach.  This test showed severe esophagitis 
(inflammation of the esophagus), the likely cause of intestinal 
bleeding.  The esophagitis was likely due to a hiatal hernia and 
acid reflux.  You were started on a medication to decrease 
stomach acid and the head of your bed should be kept elevated to 
prevent acid reflux.  Chest CT scan showed enlargement of a lung 
nodule seen on your prior scan.  You will require further 
follow-up of this nodule.  You developed thrush that was treated 
with fluconazole.  Your sarcoma pain was treated with narcotic 
pain medication, a lidocaine patch, and gabapentin (Neurontin).  
For one day, you had low oxygen levels and were confused.  This 
was likely due to overmedication with pain meds and resolved 
when the doses were decreased.  Because of all these medical 
issues, you started cancer treatment with radiation therapy and 
chemotherapy was delayed.  For unclear reasons, you developed 
acute kidney failure.  The kidney doctors recommended ___ 
biopsy, which was performed and only showed kidney damage, but 
not the actual cause.  Then the kidney function stabilized, so 
chemotherapy was started, but without cisplatin, which can 
damage kidneys.  You tolerated this well and will need to go to 
rehab for physical therapy as the tumor has caused severe 
weakness of the right leg.
.
Also, just prior to starting chemo, you had a colonoscopy for 
blood in the stool.  This showed inflammation of the rectum due 
to radiation.
.
