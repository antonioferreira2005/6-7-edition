MICRO DATA:
==========================
___ MRSA Screen: Negative

IMAGING/STUDIES:
==========================
___ CXR:  
1.  Patient is status post CABG, stented. Severely calcified 
aortic valve, 
annulus, and thoracic aorta. 
2.  Lungs are clear. 

___ CXR:
In comparison with the study of ___, there is little 
change in the 
appearance the heart and lungs and no evidence of acute 
pneumonia or vascular congestion.  Right IJ sheath is now in 
place. 

___ CTA HEAD:
1. No acute hemorrhage. 
2. Small infarction in the left frontal lobe, in the middle 
cerebral artery territory, without mass effect on with partial 
volume loss, is most likely chronic, and less likely subacute. 
3. Areas of low density in the supratentorial white matter are 
nonspecific but likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease in this age group.  In the setting, detection of small 
acute white matter infarcts is limited. 
4. Atherosclerosis of bilateral internal carotid arteries 
without 
flow-limiting stenosis. 
5. Mild short-segment atherosclerotic stenosis of the proximal 
V4 segment of the left vertebral artery. 

___ TAVR placement
PreTAVR Deployment
 No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left 
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left 
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color 
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. 
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There is mild 
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50 %). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are simple 
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three 
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely 
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve 
area 0.5cm2). Mild to moderate (___) aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral 
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is 
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. These findings were 
discussed with Drs. ___, and ___ at the time of exam 
in the operating room.
 PostTAVR Deployment
 There is a well-seated TAVR valve in place. A trace 
paravalvular leak is noted. No new regional wall motion 
abnormalities are seen. The rest of exam is unchanged from 
predeployment. The findings were discussed with the Cardiology 
and Cardiac Surgery team at the time of exam in the operating 
room.  

___ carotid US
IMPRESSION:  
Moderate heterogeneous atherosclerotic plaque in the left ICA 
resulting in no hemodynamically significant stenosis based on 
sonographic criteria. 

___ ECHO:
IMPRESSION: Well-seated Lotus aortic valve with normal 
transvalvular gradients. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation with 
moderate pulmonary hypertension.  

___ MRI Head
IMPRESSION: 
1. Motion artifact which degrades spatial resolution. 
2. Re- demonstration of a subacute infarction within the left 
mid frontal 
middle and inferior gyri. 
3. Acute punctate infarcts within the bilateral frontal 
cortices, bilateral occipital cortices, central cerebellar 
lobule and left cerebellar hemisphere. Small areas of acute 
infarction at the right posterior inferior and right anterior 
inferior cerebellar hemisphere.  Findings correspond to multiple 
vascular territories suggestive of an embolic, central source. 
No obvious evidence of hemorrhagic conversion. 
4. Background moderate volume loss and sequela of chronic 
small-vessel 
ischemic disease.

============================
___ year old female with history of CAD s/p CABG ___, PCI ___, 
HTN, osteoarthritis presented for TAVR on ___. Her course was 
complicated by word-finding difficulty on ___ after the 
procedure, and CT head showed moderate sized 3.5-4h infarct. 
Neurology recommended MRI which showed subacute infarction 
within the left mid frontal middle and inferior gyri. Multiple 
vascular territories suggestive of an embolic, central source, 
small vessel ischemic disease and acute punctate infarcts within 
multiple areas of the brain. She was seen by neurology and her 
defecits completely resolved prior to discharge. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
============================
#) SEVERE AORTIC STENOSIS:
Patient underwent TAVR on ___ for severe aortic stenosis. TEE 
post-procedure showed a well seated TAVR without wall motion 
abnormalities. 

#) ACUTE WORD FINDING DIFFICULTY:
After her TAVR on ___, patient developed acute word-finding 
difficulty, concerning for stroke. Code stroke was called, and 
CT head showed moderate sized infarct 3.5-4h infarct that 
explains symptoms, likely cardioembolism from how quickly it 
appeared. Neurology was consulted, and recommended MRI head 
without contrast. This showed multiple areas of punctate 
hemorrhage suggestive of a central embolic source. TTE with 
bubble showed no PFO. Overnight on ___, she was started on a 
nitro gtt to maintain SBP below 180s. Her pressures improved and 
she was transferred to the floor. She was seen by neurology and 
her defecits completely resolved prior to discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES:  
============================ 
#CAD: continued atorvastatin 40 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg

#HTN: continued amlodipine 5 mg

#OA: stable. 

#Depression/anxiety: continued venlafaxine 75 qAM and 37.5 qPM

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for an 
elective procedure to replace your aortic valve. You tolerated 
your procedure well, and the post-operative echocardiogram of 
your heart shows that the new valve is in the correct position. 
After the procedure, you had some word-finding difficulties and 
confusion. An MRI of your brain showed some small strokes, most 
likely from small clots that traveled to the brain from the 
aorta during your aortic valve replacement procedure. Your 
neurologic symptoms completely resolved before you were 
discharged.

It has been a pleasure taking care of you.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team
 
Followup Instructions:
