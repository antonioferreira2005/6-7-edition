Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted on ___ after undergoing endovascular 
repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm with thoracic stent graft. He 
tolerated the procedure well,and was transfered to the CVICU

blood pressure control. On POD 1 he tolerated a regular diet, 
was de-lined and transfered to the vascular floor. He remained 
in sinus rhythm with brief episodes of tachycardia to the 160s 
treated with lopressor IV with good response.  Cardiology was

atrial fibrillation.  We increased his metoprolol to 50 mg BID

weeks and Dr. ___ in 1 month with CTA.
