IMAGING/DIAGNOSTICS
___ CTA ABD AND PELVIS:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Stable appearance of wedge shaped hypodensity in the 
interpolar region of the right kidney concerning for renal 
infarct. 
2. Patent abdominal vasculature without evidence of thrombus 
within the right renal artery.

___ ECHO
IMPRESSION: No definite valvular vegetations or pathologic 
valvular flow identified. Mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and regional/global 
systolic function. Normal right ventricular cavity size and 
systolic function. Well seated bileaflet AVR with normal leaflet 
motion and higher than expected gradients. Mild central aortic 
regurgitation. 

If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D 
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis. If clinically 
warranted, a transesophageal echocardiogram is recommended.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
there has been an increase in the transvalvular gradients. Other 
findings appear similar.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and aortic 
valve endocarditis complicated by multiple embolizations 
(resulting in R eye blindness), status post mechanical aortic 
valve (___) on aspirin and warfarin who presents from ___ 
___ with subtherapeutic INR and R renal infarct, now on 
heparin drip. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# R renal infarct:
Patient presented with acute back pain and was found to have R 
renal infarct on CTA. Reportedly has intermittent compliance 
with Coumadin and difficulty getting INR checks regularly. 
Presented with subtherapeutic INR which likely led to aortic 
valve thrombus and R renal infarct. Patient was started on a 
heparin drip and was treated with warfarin 10mg. He had a 
transthoracic echo on ___ which was negative for vegetations 
or thrombus, normal mechanical leaflet motion, and showed a 
normal ejection fracition but higher than expected gradients in 
the setting of hyperdynamic LV. He was continued on his home 
aspirin. On ___, INR was 2.4. Patient was switched back to his 
home dose of warfarin 7mg. 

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================
# Mechanical AVR: 
Patient was treated with a heparin drip (see above) and warfarin 
10mg. He should continue taking his home dose of warfarin (7mg) 
when he goes home. 

# HTN:
Continued home amlodipine

# HLD:
Continued home rosuvastatin

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ] Patient should have his INR checked at ___ Lab on 
___. The results should be sent to his PCP. His goal INR 
should be 2.5-3.5 given his clotting history. 
[ ] Patient had TTE which showed well seated bileaflet AVR with 
normal leaflet motion and higher than expected gradients. He 
should have a repeat-TTE in ___ months to re-assess the 
gradients.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED?
- You were admitted because you were having back pain and 
imaging showed you had a clot in your renal artery. 

WHAT WAS DONE FOR YOU IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You were started on a medicine called heparin, which was given 
to your through your vein to help thin out your blood.
- You had an ultrasound of your heart which showed that there 
were no bacterial clots on your heart valves! This is a good 
thing! 

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WHEN YOU LEAVE?
- You should follow up with your primary care doctor
- You should continue taking your medications as prescribed. 
Specifically, you should take your Coumadin every day and have 
your INR monitored regularly to ensure your blood is 
appropriately thinned out. This will help prevent further clots 
from developing. 
- Your primary care doctor ___ write you a standing order to 
have your blood drawn at ___, and she can follow your INR 
through the PatientPortal. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team
