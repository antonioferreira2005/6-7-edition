IMAGING
=======
___: Liver U/S:
1.  Nonspecific mild echogenicity of the liver may represent 
unerlying mild diffuse hepatic steatosis. No discrete liver 
lesions identified. 
2.  Collapsed gallbladder, without evidence of biliary ductal 
dilatation.  Normal caliber common bile duct. 

___: CT Chest- Mild ground-glass opacities have improved 
since the prior study and remaining faint opacities in the right 
upper lobe may be sequela of prior infection. Slight septal 
prominence may be due to mild pulmonary edema or possibly early 
manifestation of a viral infectious process. Prevascular node 
measures 7 mm and is slightly enlarged from prior study. 
Remainder of scattered mediastinal nodes are stable. Enlarged 
main pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary hypertension. 
Findings compatible with anemia. 

___: TTE-IMPRESSION: no vegetations seen  

___: CT Abdomen/Pelvis: No evidence of infection or 
inflammation in the abdomen and pelvis. Subcentimeter liver dome 
lesion,stable, too small to fully characterize. 

___: TTE-The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF 60%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal 
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 

___: CT sinus: Dental hardware, slightly limiting evaluation 
of the oral cavity, without detected abscess. 

___: RUQ U/S:=No focal liver lesions seen.  Mild 
splenomegaly with one, and  possibly two, small echogenic 
lesions consistent with hemangiomas. 

PATHOLOGY:
==========
___: Bone marrow bx- Hypocellular marrow with no morphologic 
evidence of acute leukemia.

___: Hard Palate bx: The overall morphologic and 
immunohistochemistry pattern is consistent with mucosal 
involvement by acute myeloid leukemia. Please correlate with 
clinical and radiographic findings. 

___: Bone marrow bx- HYPERCELLULAR BONE MARROW EXTENSIVELY 
INFILTRATED WITH RELAPSED ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA

___: Liver bx- Macrovesicular steatosis, Stage II-III 
fibrosis.  Moderate to severe predominately macrovesicular 
steatosis with frequent balloon degeneration and rare 
intracytoplasmic hyalin. Mild to moderate portal and lobular, 
mixed inflammation including lymphocytes, plasma cells and 
neutrophils with scattered apoptotic hepatocytes. No viral 
cytopathic changes are seen. Trichrome stain shows increased 
portal/periportal and sinusoidal fibrosis with focal bridging 
(Stage ___ fibrosis). Iron stains shows moderate to severe iron 
deposition in predominately hepatocytes and less in Kupffer 
cells.

TRANSFUSION REACTIONS
=====================
Tansfusion history: 
Previous non-reactive red cell transfusions: 41 
Previous reactive red cell transfusions: 1 ___ allergic] 
Previous non-reactive platelet transfusions: 25 
Previous reactive platelet transfusions: 6 ___, 
___, 
___ all urticarial/allergic] 
  
DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. ___ 
experienced 
hives and lip swelling after receiving 100 cc of PRBC on ___. 

Mild allergic/urticarial reactions are thought to be mediated by 
soluble 
substances/antigens in the donor product that cause IgE mediated 

histamine release. Urticarial reactions complicate 1-3% of 
transfusions. 
The presence of one mild allergic/urticarial reaction does not 
predict 
future reactions. We recommend no changes in standard 
transfusion 
practices at this time.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION
==================================
Pt is a ___ with relapsed AML (FLT3-/NPM1+, +trisomy 15 in 
___ presenting for hematopoietic stem cell transplant

#) AML, relapsed: Pt was admitted for relapsed AML and was 
immediately started on hydroxyurea and vorinostat. After central 
access was achieved, he was started on idarubicin from day 4 to 
6, and cytarabine was given on days ___. Pt tolerated the 
chemotherapy very well and had mild dyspepsia and loose stools. 
He had bouts of thrombocytopenia which caused bloody bowel 
movements but were corrected with platelet transfusions.  Bone 
marrow biopsy on ___ showed hypocellular marrow with no 
evidence of leukemia, so went forward with MUD transplant on 
___.  Became febrile during the infusion of stem cells, so 
antibiotics started, but all cultures came back negative, so 
antibiotics were discontinued on ___.  WBC counts began 
recovering D+11 and he experienced a robust engraftment which 
did not require filgrastim.  WBC was 5,200 on discharge with no 
blasts seen.

#) LUKEMIA CUTIS: Upon admission, patient was finishing his 5 
day course of azithromycin which was empirically treating a 
sinusitis. Pt was complaining of L maxillary sinus tenderness 
and L palate swelling. CT of maxillae/sinus/mandible showed no 
signs of abscess or sinusitis but could not rule out superficial 
leukemic infiltration. ENT biopsied palate which showed leukemia 
cutis. The swelling improved while patient was receiving 
chemotherapy infusion.

#) HEPATOSTEATOSIS: Patient has a chronic history of 
transaminitis and remained stable at baseline to slightly 
elevated throughout hospital course. A liver biopsy was done a 
week before admission as an outpatient and the results ruled out 
leukemic involvement; showed presence of fatty infiltration, 
fibrosis (stage II-III) and iron deposition in hepatocytes. 
LFT's would increase with any hepatotoxic med, including 
busulfan. At time of discharge LFTs were increasing with 
instructions to follow-up closely as an outpatient with Dr. 
___.

#) HYPERGLYCEMIA: Patient was hyperglycemic throughout hospital 
course and was especially hyperglycemic in the 300-400s while on 
the four day course of dexamethasone. During this time he 
required at least 65 U of insulin per day. ___ was consulted 
and recommended a sliding scale to manage the blood glucose 
after the four day course of dexamethasone. 

#) FEBRILE NON-HEMOLYTIC TRANSFUSION REACTIONS- Fever, rigors, 
and chills shortly after SCT. Associated with tachypnea and 
tachycardia.  Differential was allergic reaction to blood 
products versus infection.  CT chest negative for infectious 
process.  Blood, urine cultures negative.  Nevertheless, was 
treated with cefepime and vancomycin ___.

#) GPC SEPSIS- S. epi and S. Viridans sepsis during conditioning 
prior to transplant (cultures positive on ___, transplanted on 
___  Central line pulled and positive for S. epi. TTE 
performed, not indicitive of IE, but windows very poor given pt 
body habitus. No positive cultures after initial infection.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Follow-up with PCP regarding diabetes management (oral 
hypoglycemics)
- Follow-up with Dr. ___ as outpatient, and plan for 
transplant
- Follow-up with hepatologist or establish pt with one to 
followup on hepatic fibrosis, severe iron deposition in 
hepatocytes and NASH.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was our pleasure taking care of you at the ___.
You were admitted to the ___ 
after you were found to have atypical immature cells in your 
laboratory blood work. Because of this, your relapsed AML was 
treated with hydroxyurea, vorinostat, and IV infusion of 
idarubicin and cytarabine. You tolerated the chemotherapy very 
well. Your blood sugars were very high especially while 
receiving steroids, and required an endocrinologist/diabetes 
specialist to help adjust your insulin scales.

In the weeks prior to your stem cell transplant, you spiked a 
fever and blood cultures showed bacteria growing in your blood. 
You were given IV antibiotics for this, your fever stopped, and 
no other culture grew out bacteria. One of these bacteria is 
usually associated with an infection of the heart. 
Unfortunately, we could not perform the right test to fully 
exclude a heart infection. The name of the test is a 
transesophageal echocardiogram or TEE. This should be considered 
now that your blood counts have normalized. 

You were bone marrow was transplanted with stem cells from a 
matched unrelated donor. You were treated with chemotherapy 
prior to transplant. This was complicated by a slight increase 
in liver enzymes, however, they came down to normal before your 
transplant. After transplant you had a very high temperature, 
respiratory difficulties, and high heart rate for several days. 
We believe this was a reaction to the cells, and not a true 
infection.  

In the following days your white blood cell (infection-fighting 
cells) began to recover robustly, and did not require the use of 
filgrastim (Neupogen.)  Your antibiotics were discontinued and 
you showed no further signs of infection.

We attempted to start you on metformin for high blood sugars, 
but you developed a rash which we believe was an allergic 
reaction to this drug.

Please follow up in clinic daily for lab draws through the 
weekend and see Dr. ___ on ___ as outlined below.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
