IMAGING:
. 
RENAL ULTRASOUND:
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 12.3 cm in its long axis. 
The left
kidney measures 12.4 cm in its long axis. Neither kidney 
demonstrates stones, masses, or hydronephrosis. No perinephric 
fluid collection is noted. The transverse and sagittal views of 
the bladder demonstrat it to be partially decompressed with no 
overt abnormality.
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
#Urinary tract infection: On presentation the patient had 
tenderness to palpation of the RLQ and right flank. UA and 
urinary culture was obtained in the ED. The patient's symptoms 
were thought to be due to her previously diagnosed UTI (see 
previous hospital discharge). However, pyelonephritis was 
considered as a cause given the presence of flank pain. She was 
started on IV ciprofloxacin given previous culture data out of 
concern that her persistent/worsening pain symptoms represented 
treatment failure from potential poor oral absorption.  The 
patient never had costovertebral angle tenderness or fevers 
through her hospital course. She had a repeat renal U/S that 
showed no perinephric fluid collection and no stones. Urine 
culture was finalized on day of discharge and returned negative. 
She was discharged home with another 8-day course of 
Ciprofloxacin given the presence, but improvement in her 
RLQ/right flank pain and mildly positive UA in the ED.
.
#Pain control. Pain regimen at home was unclear. Patient 
presented to the hospital taking Methadone as needed for pain, 
though patient reports taking this medication sporadically. 
Methadone was not continued through the admission. Her pain was 
adequately controlled on regimen of 10 Oxycontin BID and 10mg 
Oxycodone PRN q4hours and Acetaminophen 650mg standing. 
Evaluation of her pain regimen revealed patient was taking 20 mg 
of methadone and five ___ Percocets all at once in the morning 
with poor pain control.  Counseled on appropriate dosing and 
discharged patient on 5 mg methadone BID with 5 mg oral 
oxycodone every six hours as needed for pain with standing 1000 
mg acetaminophen every six hours, with follow up with her PCP 
for evaluation of pain control.  Told NOT to take home Percocet 
while taking acetaminophen, and counseled on sedating effects of 
narcotics/not to drive while on this medication.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#Hypertension. Patient remained normotensive through the 
admission. Her home hydrochlorathiazide and verapamil were 
continued.
.
#GERD: Home omeprazole was continued. 
.
#Asthma. No recent flares. Continued home Advair diskus with PRN 
albuterol available. 
.
#Depression/Mood disorder. Major depressive disorder per 
psychiatry evaluation in ___. Patient had a flat affect and 
seemed removed from her situation. She denied suicidal and 
homicidal ideation. Note of several psychosocial stressors and 
recent possible abuse by boyfriend in ___. Home mirtazapine was 
continued through the hospitalization. Follow-up with psychiatry 
was made for major depressive disorder. 
.
#Smoking cessation. Patient does not use nicotine gum, though 
she has been prescribed in the past. Lozenge was available to 
the patient in hospital to avoid tobacco withdrawal. Patient was 
re-offered nicotine patch, gun, and lozenge, but she refused. 
.
#Vulvar Prurigo Nodularis. Patient with a history of multiple 
itchy lesions on vulva that she has had for years. Home 
betamethasone and Mupirocin were continued through the 
hospitalization.
.
Transition of Care:
- pain management with methadone. Perhaps PCP and patient should 
enter narcotics contract.
- follow-up with psychiatry for management of major depressive 
disorder.
