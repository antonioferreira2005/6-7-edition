Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to ___ on ___ for planned 
Right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and biopsy of 
mediastinal mass. The procedure went well without complications. 
She did well postop. Postop chest xray showed no signs of 
pneumothorax or effusion. She was transferred to the floor from 
PACU on the same day. The chest tube drained about 100cc on 
POD0, then about 10cc overnight, so it was removed on POD1. PA 
and Lateral Chest Xray was then obtained, which showed very 
small pneumothorax, which is common after similar procedure and 
not to be concerned. She was normalized, tolerated regular diet 
well, voided without issues, got up from bed and walked in the 
hallway. Decision was made to keep her in till the biopsy 
results of the mediastinal  mass came back to plan her further 
treatment. She did well on POD2, POD3, POD4 without any issues. 
We received preliminary results of the biopsy today which 
indicates that she likely has benign lesion, likely thymic 
hyperplasia. We discussed the results with her and offered 
excision of the mediastinal mass which she agreed with and 
consented. The procedure is scheduled for ___.
