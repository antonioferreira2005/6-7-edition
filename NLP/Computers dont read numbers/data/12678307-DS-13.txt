History of Present Illness:
___ is an ___ year old woman w/PMH HFpEF, mixed severity 
AS, afib on apixaban, HTN, HLD, CKD III presenting with 
shortness of breath.

Patient had a recent admission from ___ where she 
presented with DOE and chest/shoulder discomfort. She was found 
to be in a heart failure exacerbation with new afib. She was 
diuresed with IV Lasix with improvement in hre dyspnea. For her 
afib, she was started on apixaban and amiodarone and underwent 
DCCV with restoration of sinus rhythm. For her anginal symptoms, 
she underwent pMIBI which did not show perfusion defects 
(coronary angiography was deferred due to ___. She was found to 
have progression in severity of her aortic stenosis during this 
hospitalization and was evaluated by the TAVR team. TAVR was 
deferred pending coronary angiography to assess for severe CAD. 
Notably, the patient's home BP meds were held during this 
admission due to orthostatic hypotension requiring midodrine 
thought to be secondary to diuresis. She was not discharged on 
anti-hypertensives or diuretics.

Since discharge, she has continued to have shortness of breath 
with exertion with occasional associated chest/shoulder 
discomfort. This evening when she was walking to the bathroom, 
she developed acute onset worsening shortness of breath which 
she describes as feeling wheezy. She initially sat and waited 
for her breathing to improve, however, when it did not improve, 
she called EMS. EMS arrived and gave the patient 4x SL 
nitroglycerin, nitroglycerin paste, 20mg Diltiazem, 40mg IV 
Lasix and placed her on CPAP for SpO2 82% on room air. 

In the ED,  
- Initial vitals were: HR 102 BP 132/100 RR 26 SpO2 94% bipap  
- Exam notable for:  Speaking in ___ word sentences, moderate 
respiratory distress, tachycardic, irregularly irregular, coarse 
breath sounds bilaterally with wheezing in LLL, skin warm and 
dry, no peripheral edema
- Labs notable for: WBC 11.1 ___ 15158 Cr 1.9 trop 0.08
- Studies notable for: CXR showing interval worsening of now 
mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and edema. 

On arrival to the CCU, she states that her breathing is 
significantly improved. She is not currently having chest pain 
or shortness of breath. Denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, or dysuria. Per patient's granddaughter, her BPs at 
home had improved since discharge to the 140s systolic.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
___ w/ new HFpEF and atrial fibrillation on apixaban (new as of 
___, low flow/low gradient severe AS, HTN, HLD, and CKD III 
who presented with shortness of breath, found to have acute 
hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary congestion 
from a HFpEF exacerbation, with course c/b afib with RVR.

She required one night in the CCU for diuresis and BIPAP. 

Notably, patient was discharged on ___, one day prior to this 
re-admission, for similar (albeit less severe) symptoms. Due to 
orthostasis, she was not discharged on a diuretic. Furthermore, 
she was started on amiodarone s/p successful DCCV for new atrial 
fibrillation during that admission, though was not discharged on 
beta blockade due to sinus bradycardia.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Acute heart failure exacerbation (HFpEF, EF 57%):
# Hypoxia:
# NSTEMI II:

shortness of breath and a 4L O2 requirement. proBNP was 15,000. 
Symptoms improved with BIPAP and 40 mg IV lasix. During this 
episode, she also had a mild troponin elevation with peak of 
0.23, and no ECG changes, likely demand in nature. 
- PRELOAD: Torsemide 5 mg PO daily
- AFTERLOAD: held iso soft BPs

# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:
CHADS2-VASc of 5, diagnosed on previous admission (___), 
s/p successful DCCV on ___. She was initiated on amiodarone 
and apixaban 2.5mg BID. Beta blocker was held at discharge due 
to sinus bradycardia. During this admission, pt developed afib 
with rates in the 120s. She was initiated on metoprolol 
succinate 12.5 mg BID in addition to amiodarone. She was in 
sinus rhythm at discharge. 

# Severe aortic stenosis:
From discharge paperwork (___): TTE from ___ w/ normal EF 
and mild AS. Repeat TTE (___) with ___ 0.5cm2, mean gradient 
22, peak velocity 3.1m/s. Overall consistent with low gradient 
aortic stenosis presumed due to hypertrophied LV with small 
cavity. Evaluated by structural heart team who recommended 
management of afib and evaluation for CAD. pMIBI negative. RHC 
consistent with ECHO, showing severe aortic stenosis with mean 
transvalvular gradient 24 mm Hg, and calculated ___ 0.78 cm2. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Acute on chronic kidney disease:
Admission Cr 1.9, discharge creatinine 2.2, up from most recent 
discharge creatinine 1.7. Likely component of cardiorenal 
disease.

bid, Lisinopril 30 mg and amlodipine 2.5 mg throughout admission 
in light of soft SBPs and renal function.

while inpatient. 

# Polymyalgia rheumatic:
Gabapentin at 200 mg BID, reduced from 400 mg BID in light of 
worsening renal function. 

# Insomnia:
Continued home Zolpidem ___ mg QHS:PRN; generally only required 
5 mg.
