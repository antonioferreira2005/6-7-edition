tachycardic and hypertensive during an ED evaluation for facial 
swelling.
.  
#Tachycardia:
We suspect the cause was partly sympathetically mediated. Pt 
describes her heart rate being very variable depending on her 
surroundings. If she is very anxious, it will increase. Another 
possibility for her tachycardia is her repeated albuterol use. 
Pt stated requiring 2+ puffs per day and had inhaler beside.  
Patients tox screen was positive for benzos, which she takes 
twice a day and had been on stable dose for months. Patient was 
placed on telemetry and observed and did not show any concernign 
patterns. Patient was reassured and stable when discharged.
. 
#Hypertension:
Patient was found to have a blood pressure of 200/110 when 
presenting to the ED with facial swelling. Given the possibility 
of angioedema, her lisinopril was stopped and patient was 
started on HCTZ. Patient described white coat hypertension, but 
given persistent finding started on anti-hypertensive. Patient 
will continue HCTZ 25mg and follow-up with her PCP ___ 1 week to 
assess need for further treatment.
.  
#Anxiety: Patient outpatient regimen of 40mg paxil and 5mg 
valium BID were continued. Patient required constant reassurance 
that her condition was not grave and that, though she was in the 
hospital, it was mostly for observation. Patient improved and 
felt comfortable going home.
.
#Facial swelling: This issue had mostly resolved by the time of 
transfer to the floor. There was no evidence of airway 
compromise. Description of cheek swelling and face tightness 
does not seem like angioedema, but drug was discontinued and 
changed to HCTZ. Given patients history of allergic rhinitis, 
could be a component of this causing the facial swelling.
.
#Asthma: Patient described significant albuterol use and this 
likely ___ contributing to her tachycardia. Patient was given a 
prescription for fluticasone upon discharge. Patient will 
follow-up with PCP ___ 1 week of discharge.
.  
#Allergic rhinitis: Continued on intranasal flonase
