Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on 
___ after presentation to ___ with 
worsening abdominal pain and subsequent transfer to ___ after 
CT at ___ showed findings concerning for 
intussusception. Admission CT  at ___ revealed status post 
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with no focal abnormalities identified 
at the anastomotic site.  Also, no findings suggestive of 
intussusception identified in the region of the jejunojejunal 
anastomosis. There was further work up with a small bowel 
enteroscopy on ___ that showed normal esophageal mucosa, 
no evidence of gastric pouch and proximal anastamosis 
ulceration, and no evidence of distal anastomosis ulceration. 
Additionally, a BAS/UGI AIR/SBFT was performed on ___ and 
showed no evidence of gastrogastric fistula, leak or 
obstruction. Oral contrast flowed freely through the 
gastrojejunostomy loop into the jejunum. U/A on admission 
indicated a UTI with cultures of klebsiella pneumoniae and she 
was treated with Augmentin for 5 days. 

Upon hearing that her UGI with SBFT was normal she decided that 
she would prefer to follow up with her own bariatric surgeon on 
___ since she already had an appointment. Since she 
was taking in adequate PO, making good urine output, and in no 
acute distress this was deemed reasonable and she was discharged 
with instructions to follow up with her surgeon and seek 
immediate medical attention should the pain worsen, she develop 
vomiting, inability to pass flatus, or fevers. 

Throughout her stay, ___ was tolerating a Bari 3- 
diet with some nausea, she took an average of 1 liter in a day. 
She was able to tolerate oral pain medications during her stay. 
At the time of discharge her diet included soft diet to advance 
to regular diet as per patient comfort. The patient voided 
without problem. During this hospitalization, the patient 
ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory 
toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in 
the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin 
during this stay.  

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating diet as 
above per oral with some nausea and diarrhea, ambulating, 
voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled. The 
patient was discharged home without services. The patient 
received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with 
understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.
