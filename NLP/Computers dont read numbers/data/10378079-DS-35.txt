IMAGING:

CT HEAD ___

FINDINGS:  
  
Again seen is a right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter, 
unchanged in position with the tip in the left lateral ventricle 
near the foramen of ___. The ventricles demonstrate minimal 
progressive increase in measurements over the past 2 exams, with 
the right frontal horn measuring 11 mm (previously 11 mm and 10 
mm) and the third ventricle measuring 5 mm (previously 5 mm and 
3 mm). It is unclear if these differences are due to differences 
in planes of scanning versus true minimal increase in size.  
There is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or mass. 
  
There is no evidence of fracture.  There is a small amount of 
fluid layering in the left maxillary sinus.  The other 
visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear 
cavities are clear.  The visualized portion of the orbits are 
unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Unchanged position of a right frontal approach 
ventriculostomy catheter, with the tip terminating in the left 
lateral ventricle near the foramen of ___. 
2. Minimal progressive increase in ventricular measurements 
compared to ___ and ___, unclear if due to true 
minimally 
increased size versus differences in planes of scanning. 

CXR (PA/LATERAL) ___

IMPRESSION:  
  
In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower 
lung volumes. This probably accounts for the increased 
prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Retrocardiac 
opacification most likely represents atelectatic changes. 
However, in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of 
a superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. No 
evidence of vascular congestion.  Central catheter extends to 
the mid to lower portion of the SVC. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: ___  with a history of a tectal 
primary CNS lymphoma, who now has an aggressive non-Hodgkin's 
systemic lymphoma being treated with rituximab/EPOCH and IT 
chemotherapy prophylaxis, s/p Ommaya placement ___,
presenting for initiation of C5 of EPOCH but on admission noted 
to have two days of acute headache, nausea and vomiting but 
without evidence of acute process on CT head.

C5D6 - ___

ACTIVE ISSUES:

#Hypotension: Asymptomatic and resolved, noted 70/40 x1 on 
___. Unclear etiology but likely dehydration as weight was 
down 3lbs from baseline on ___. No evidence of GI loss besides 
diarrhea the day prior. Eating and drinking well. Did not 
receive diuresis this cycle which is often typical with EPOCH 
regimen. There's always concern for infection but leukocytosis 
resolved as below, no bandemia and
patient has had no fevers, chills or rigors. Blood culture ___ 
without growth. ECG ___ unremarkable. Interestingly, patient 
now developed higher blood pressures as below and was initiated 
on anti-HTN, see below

#Headache: Resolved. Differential includes possible post 
procedural headache vs infectious complication vs new mechanical 
obstruction from recently omaya placement, though ___ is 
reassuring against hemorrhage or ventricular obstruction.
Headache occurred within 48 hours following IT liposomal 
cytarabine on ___ so most likely she experienced chemical 
meningitis symptoms from the IT-arac. Neuro-onc agrees that her 
symptoms likely chemical meningitis as well, see Dr. ___ 
note on ___. Her CSF from ___ did not show evidence of 
infection or malignant cells. Also, no fevers, chills or rigors 
so less likely infectious etiology. Did have leukocytosis on 
admission but now resolved. No bandemia on differential. Normal 
neuro exam and mental status. Discharged with dexamethasone 4mg 
BID and Tylenol PRN, monitor closely outpatient. Will likely 
need taper of her steroids outpatient.

#Hyperglycemia/Glucosuria: Noted in the setting steroids 
initiation as part of chemotherapy regimen. Of note, patient has 
been on dexamethasone 4mg BID outpatient and it is unclear if 
her glucose levels were elevated. She was initiated on insulin 
sliding scale on ___ while in-house as her FBG were ranging 
between high 100s to low 300s. Discharged with glucometer and 
supplies needed to check glucose pre-meals. Advised to call if 
glucose consistently > 150-200. ___ likely need an 
endocrinologist follow up outpatient as she is at risk for 
steroid-induced DM. 

#HTN: Previously on amlodipine 10mg PO daily, discontinued given 
stable pressures per outpatient team; noted uptrend of blood 
pressures with a peak SBP of 178 while in-house; therefore, 
started on amlodipine 5mg po daily on ___. Some mild 
improvement at discharge. 

#Blurred Vision/Dry Eyes: C/o dry eyes and blurred vision on 
___ evening but reports this issue has been ongoing but did 
not mention as she was hoping it will go away. Blurred vision 
may be a symptom of HTN. Prior to discharge, reported that these 
symptoms were significantly improved. No other associated visual 
disturbances. Was given artificial drops to help with dry eyes. 
Follow up appointment with Dr. ___ on ___ at 2:15pm

#Constipation: Stool x 1 on ___ prior to discharge, continue 
with bowel regimen. 

#Cough: Mild at discharge. Has had ongoing cough which has been 
present for over a month per outpatient clinic on ___ of 
which was attributed to sinusitis per evidence on Sinus CT - of 
note did complete a course of antibiotics with augmentin at that 
time. On admission, patient reports that cough resolved but 
returned about 1 week ago; denies sick contacts, fevers, chills, 
rigors, sinus tenderness or rhinorrhea. Occasionally does cough 
up yellow sputum but none since admission. CXR on admission 
showed retrocardiac opacification which most likely represents 
atelectatic changes but cannot rule out superimposed PNA.
-Did not receive empiric ABX
-consider NCCT chest if symptoms worsens, monitor closely 
outpatient 

#Nausea/Vomiting: Noted on admission but none since then. Likely 
chemotherapy effect as last received IT-ara-c on ___ and may 
evolve with current cycle of EPOCH. Continues w/ zofran and 
ativan for relief as needed, monitor closely outpatient.

CHRONIC ISSUES/RESOLVED:

#High grade B-cell lymphoma: Currently being treated with 
DA-EPOCH now s/p C5 of regimen at dose level 2; last received 
rituximab on ___ and ppx IT liposomal cytarabine (C5D1 
___. Continued on prophylaxis with acyclovir, bactrim
(changed to suspension for ease of swelling recently) and 
lamivudine per primary oncologist, starting neupogen on ___

#CNS lymphoma: Stable, getting treatment as above. Missed her 
outpatient appointment with Dr. ___ on ___ but received 
last dose of IT-arac as above. No evidence of malignant cells on 
most recent cytology on ___.

#Leukocytosis: Resolved, likely neupogen effect. Patient with 
WBC of 65 on ___ and 10.5. Infectious w/u negative

#Hepatitis B: HBsAb and HBcAb positive. On lamuvidine 100mg PO 
daily, continue for 6 months following treatment for lymphoma.

#HLD: restarted simvastatin at discharge, held during 
chemotherapy infusion

#History of HSV Infection: Noted during MTX treatment. No 
evidence of active infection on admission, continue with 
acyclovir 400mg TID

home
#Hyperglycemia: No insulin at discharge, ___ to check glucose 
pre-meals at home, patient has necessary supplies
#NHL/CNS Lymphoma: Neupogen to start on ___, s/p C5 of 
EPOCH, continues on dex 4mg PO BID at discharge
