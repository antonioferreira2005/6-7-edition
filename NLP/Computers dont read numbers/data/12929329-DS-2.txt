Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ yo man with history of HIV on Triumeq, IV drug use 
and multiple episodes of cellulitis presenting with two day 
history of right wrist pain and swelling after injecting crystal 
meth into his wrist. He was admitted for management of 
cellulitis. He was afebrile with no leukocytosis or evidence of 
sepsis throughout his admission. Blood cultures were drawn and 
did not grow anything by the time of discharge. He was initially 
started on Vancomycin and Unasyn. He was evaluated by the 
surgical team who felt that this was simple cellulitis and they 
were not concerned about necrotizing fasciitis or septic 
arthritis. He was monitored for 24 hours and his hand pain 
improved significantly. We transitioned him to oral Keflex and 
Bactrim to complete a 10 day course. He should have follow up 
with his PCP on discharge to be re-evaluated.

He also developed some abdominal cramping, nausea, and vomiting 
prior to discharge. His abdominal exam was benign. Suspect his 
symptoms are most likely due to combination of nausea from 
antibiotics as well as constipation. He was given anti-emetics 
with good effect, and was tolerating PO by the time of 
discharge. 

Transitional Issues:
[] Follow up rash within 48-72 hours to monitor clinical 
improvement.
[] Complete 10 day course of Keflex and Bactrim (end date ___
[] Provide patient with resources for ongoing substance abuse
[] F/u pending blood cultures at ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ because you were having right hand 
pain. You have a skin infection called "cellulitis" that we 
treated with IV antibiotics. Your hand improved slightly so we 
felt that you could be discharged home on antibiotic medication 
by mouth. Our colleagues from the surgery team evaluated your 
hand and did not feel that you had a deeper infection of the 
joint or underlying tissues. We would recommend that you see 
your PCP next week and that you avoid anything that could injure 
your arm and hand to prevent future infections.  

You were also having some abdominal cramping. We believe this is 
due to constipation. The antibiotics can cause some GI upset as 
well. We will prescribe you some medication to help you move 
your bowels, and for stomach upset. 

We wish you all the best.

Sincerely,

Your care team at ___
