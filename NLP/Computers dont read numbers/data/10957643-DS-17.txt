Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ___ surgical service under 
Dr. ___ undergoing an incisional hernia repair, left 
inguinal hernia repair with mesh. The patient tolerated the 
procedure well. There were no intraoperative complications. 
Please refer to the separate operative note for full details of 
the procedure. 

On POD 0 the patient's pain was controlled on PO oxycodone and 
IV morphine. The patient was started on a clear liquid diet. The 
patient failed to void 6 hours post procedure and was straight 
cathed for ~600cc of urine. 

On POD 1 the patient continued to be unable to void and 
therefore a Foley catheter was placed early in the morning. He 
was having more pain and was placed on PCA to optimize pain 
control.

During the following 2 days the patient's diet was gradually 
advanced to regular without nausea or vomiting. He was also 
transitioned to po pain medications with good pain control 
results. A second attempt at removing the Foley catheter was 
made but again he failed to void. The Foley was replaced and 
Urology notified, who advised on leaving the catheter in until a 
follow up appointment for a voiding trial.

At time of discharge on POD 4 the patients pain was controlled 
on oral pain medication, the patient was ambulating without 
assistance, and tolerating a regular diet. He has a Foley 
catheter in place with great urine output recorded due to 
failure to void in the postoperative period. The rest of the 
patient's hospitalization was uneventful. He is being discharged 
home with follow up appointments with Urology for Foley removal 
and Dr. ___ op visit.
