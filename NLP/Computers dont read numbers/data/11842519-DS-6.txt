1. Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated right and

filling pressures with RVEDP 30 mmHg and PCWP 32 mmHg. There was 
severe 
pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 68 mmHg. The cardiac 
index was 
preserved at 3.4 L/min/m2. The pulmonary vascular resistance was 
mildly 
elevated at 144 dyn-sec/cm5. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Markedly elevated biventricular filling pressures. 
2. Severe pulmonary hypertension. 
3. Recommend increased diuresis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
___ female w ___ p/w increasing ___, SOB, rising creatinine in 
setting of diuresis, R heart cath demonstrating elevated wedge, 
RA, PA pressures, found to have likely interstitial nephritis as 
a result of lasix (sulfa- allergy) switched to ethacrynic acid 
with improvement in symptoms and kidney function.
.  
ACTIVE
# ARF: Pt a/w rising Cr to 3.4 in setting of outpatient and 
inpatient diuresis with lasix and metolazone.  Her ACE was held 
and she was originally treated with aggressive lasix and 
metolazone for suspected etiology of poor forward flow.  On 
consultation with renal service, white cell casts were noted in 
the urine with positive urine eos as well, suggesting possible 
AIN etiology ___ to sulfa allergy (lasix/metolazone).  Patient 
lasix, metolazone, omeprazole (all sulfa containing drugs) were 
discontinued and patient was started on ethacrynic acid with 
good effect. Her CaCO3 was increased to TID w meals.  Cr trended 
down to 2.5 and patient was discharged with close outpatient 
follow up with primary care doctor.  
.  
#Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: Pt w known ___, who presented 
with wt gain, SOB, cath findings c/w worsening failure and 
pulmonary hypertension, c/b ARF.  Patient was started on revatio 
(sildenafil) for treatment of worsening pHTN.  As above patient 
was treated with ethacrynic acid with symptomatic improvement.
.
#Tremor: During this hospitalization, patient developed new 
onset intentional tremor w/o focal neurologic signs in setting 
of rising BUN to 115.  On review of the case, it was thought 
this was a result of worsening uremia, and that there were not 
other possible medication or medical etiologies.  The tremor 
began to resolve w trending down of BUN.  
.  
# Chronic Anemia: Patient's HCT remained stable at 23.2 and 
patient was asymptomatic.  Renal consult did not believe epo was 
necessary at this time.  Her home Fe was increased to BID from 
daily. 
.  
# CORONARIES:  Patient was continued on home ASA, metoprolol, 
lipitor.  As discussed above, lisinopril was held ___ ARF.  
.
# DM c/b neuropathy: Patient was continued on Lantus 50 units 
qHS, sliding scale insulin.  She was continued on home 
amitriptyline 75 mg qHS.  Her gabapentin was decreased to daily 
dosing given her worsening renal function. 
.
# GERD: As discussed above, patient's omeprazole was 
discontinued as a result of sulfa allergy and AIN concerns.  She 
was started on ranitidine.  
.
# HTN: Patient was continued on home amlodipine, clonidine, 
hydralazine, and metoprolol succinate.  
.
# Hypothyroid: Patient was continued on Synthroid 88 mcg daily
.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted with shortness of breath and 
swelling of your legs.  This is likely due to a combination of 
heart failure (less effective pumping of blood by your heart) 
and a reaction of your kidneys to lasix.  You were treated with 
a different kind of diuretic called ethacrynic acid.  You 
improved and were ready for discharge.  

During this hospitalization, the following changes were made to 
your medications:
-STOPPED lasix
-STOPPED metolazone
-STOPPED omeprazole
-STARTED ethacrynic acid
-STARTED ranitidine
-INCREASED iron (to twice a day)
-INCREASED calcium (to three times a day with meals)
-DECREASED gabapentin/neurontin (to one time a day, because of 
your changing kidney function)
-STOPPED LISINOPRIL
-STARTED REVATIO
