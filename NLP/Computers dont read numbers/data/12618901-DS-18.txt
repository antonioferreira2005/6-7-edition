# Epistaxis / Acute Blood Loss Anemia / Coagulopathy: Pt 
presenting with epistaxis in the setting of supratherapeutic 
INR. S/p silver nitrate and surgicel. Seen by ENT in the ED. 
Epistaxis largely resolved at this point. Pt is now s/p 10 mg IV 
vitamin K. 2 u FFP given.  Hgb down to 7.2 and he received 1 u 
RBC on ___ as he dropped significantly and may require ongoing 
anticoagulation.  His post transfusion hgb 8.  Instructions re: 
packing in d/c instructions: absorbable, does not need 
prophylacitc antibiotics, will see ent for f/u in 2 weeks.  INR 
on ___.   Patient will get INR checked at ___ 
clinic on ___ and if INR<2 can resume coumadin but at lower 
dose (avoid doses of 7.5-10mg) to keep INR close to ___ rather 
than higher.  Not sure why his INR rose so quickly: no recent 
antibiotics or diet changes.  He did describe some dark stools 
but in context of swallowing some of the blood from epistaxis.

Discharge Instructions:
you were hospitalized for a serious nose bleed that required 
packing of your nose and treatment with blood transfusion, 
reversal of your inr with vitamin k and plasma

The nasal packing placed today will dissolve on its own in ___
days. The patient does not require antibiotics for this packing.
Do not be alarmed if nasal secretions are brown tinged as this 
is
due to discoloration from this dressing.
- Continue epistaxis precautions x2 weeks. (Avoid nose blowing.
Sneeze with the mouth open. Avoid vigorous activity, straining,
or heavy lifting.)
___
If the patient redevelops a nosebleed: 
1. Spray three sprays of Afrin in each nostril. 2. Apply 
pressure
to the outside of the nose (over the flexible end of the nose)
for 30 minutes and lean forward so that the patient does not
swallow blood.  Hold constant, firm pressure for the entire
duration without "peeking" to see if it has stopped as this will
likely result in repeated bleeding.  If the patient continues to
have a nose bleed or if the bleeding is very rapid or excessive,
please have patient present to the nearest emergency department
emergently for medical evaluation or if the patient is
hospitalized page Otolaryngology. 
___
In order to decrease the risk for future nosebleeds, we 
recommend
the following strategies:
- Avoid aspirin or other similar medications, unless medically
necessary
- If the patient is on Coumadin or other blood thinners, we
recommend tight management to avoid excessive blood thinning
which can cause recurrent bleeding. This patient will likely
require reversal of his INR given the extreme elevation.
- If the patient has elevated blood pressure, keeping the blood
pressure controlled will decrease the risk for future bleeds.
- Avoid trauma to the nose.  This includes irritation from
exploring digits (nose picking) and excessive nose blowing.  If
you sneeze or cough, do so with a widely open mouth to avoid
excessive pressure buildup in your nose.
- - Maintain nasal moisture by using a room humidifier at night,
especially during the dry winter months will keep the nose moist
and less susceptible to bleeding. Use nasal saline mist, two
sprays to each nostril at least four times daily. 

 
Followup Instructions:
