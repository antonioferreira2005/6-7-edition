Brief Hospital Course:
___ gentleman with history of multiple myeloma 
complicated by renal failure status post transplant, history of 
prostate cancer recently completed radiation, hypertension and 
diabetes who presented as an outside hospital transfer for 
further management of AMS and seizures in setting of UTI.

On admission to ___ he was started on cvEEG which showed left 
sided PLEDS. He received a repeat 500IV Depakote load - received 
load at OSH- and his scheduled Depakote was increased from 500mg 
BID to ___ TID. Level noted to be therapeutic. He was 
maintained on his home keppra 750mg BID (renally dosed). cvEEG 
improved and came of on ___. He underwent a CT head which showed 
a calcification in the left basal ganglia, which has been seen 
on prior CT head several years ago. This was thought to be the 
seizure trigger. Unfortunately, patient was unable to undergo 
MRI brain to further assess the calcification as he does have a 
piece of metal in his eye since ___.

Urine cx at the OSH grew Klebsiella for which he was started on 
Ceftriaxone on ___. His mental status improved and etiology 
of his altered mental status was thought be secondary to UTI. He 
was transferred to the ___ on ___. 

For his afib he was maintained on his home ASA325mg (not on AC 
___ recent GI bleed) and rate was controlled with Lopressor.

Renal transplant service was notified on admission and followed

Klebsiella UTI (___).

He subsequently passed his swallow study.  He was monitored 
several days with improvement in his clinical status. 

On the day of discharge, his transplant team also reviewed his 
medications and agreed with the plan to go to rehab.
