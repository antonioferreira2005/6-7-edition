Pulm: bronchial breath sounds on right, comfortable, good 
airmovement, no rhonchi or rales
Abdomen:  soft, moderate tenderness throughout, no rebound or 
guarding

 
Pertinent Results:
CXR:
The lungs remain hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease.  Right basilar opacity is seen which may be 
due to partial right lower lobe collapse with possible small 
right pleural effusion.  No  focal consolidation or pleural 
effusion is seen in the left lung.  There is no evidence of 
pneumothorax.  Biapical pleural thickening is again seen.  The 
cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. The previously 
questioned nodular opacity projecting anteriorly just above the 
hilar level on the lateral view is not well seen on the current 
study and may have been artifactual.  My read:  appears similar 
to prior

CT abdomen/pelvis:
1. Diffuse colonic wall edema consistent with pancolitis, which 
could be infectious, inflammatory or less likely ischemic in 
etiology.  No evidence of obstruction or toxic megacolon.   
  
2.  Stable severe intra and extrahepatic biliary dilatation. 
  
3.  Collapse of the right lung lower lobe which is not fully 
imaged. Cannot exclude an obstructing lesion. Consider 
nonemergent evaluation with dedicated contrast enhanced chest 
CT. 
  
4. Sub-4 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule for which follow up 
CT in ___ year can be considered to document stability.
