HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and underwent
central line placement to begin therapy.  His admission
weight was 97 kg and he received interleukin-2, ___
international units per kilo, equalling 48.8 million units IV
q.8 hours x14 potential doses.  During this week, he received
7 of 14 doses with 7 doses held related to worsening renal
failure, transaminitis and acute pulmonary edema.  Other side
effects during this week included rigors improved with
Demerol; nausea and vomiting improved with antiemetic
therapy; and development of an erythematous skin rash.  Pain
was well controlled throughout hospitalization with increased
OxyContin to 20 mg b.i.d. with p.r.n. oxycodone.

On treatment day #3, the patient was noted to be tachypneic
with mild hypoxia overnight.  At that time his IV fluids were
decreased and IL-2 therapy was held after 7 doses.  He
subsequently developed increased tachypnea and shortness of
breath with stable O2 sats which progressed requiring
nebulizer treatments and supplemental oxygen.  He
additionally required IV Lasix for diuresis with improvement.
He subsequently improved from a respiratory standpoint but
due to his other medical issues, IL-2 was not resumed.

During this week, he developed acute renal failure with a
peak creatinine of 4.7 with associated anuria, prompting

Electrolytes were monitored and repleted per protocol.  IV
fluids were decreased given acute pulmonary edema in the

noted to have difficulty voiding and a bladder scan was done
revealing 900 cc in his bladder.  Straight cath was performed
with 900 cc drained.  He subsequently voided on his own

at the time of discharge was down to 3.4.  During this week
he had transaminitis with a peak ALT of 148 and a peak AST of
222, both improved at the time of discharge.  This was
concerning mostly for his hepatitis C history and as noted
his LFTs did improve with discontinuation of therapy.  He was
anemic without need for packed red blood cell transfusion.
He developed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count low of
112,000 without evidence of bleeding.  He had no coagulopathy
or myocarditis noted.
He was noted to have toxic encephalopathy with some confusion
after 7 doses of IL-2.  Frequent safety checks were
