Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
T6 cord compression, NSTEMI

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
T4-T7 Laminectomy
 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old man with severe COPD on 3L home O2, HTN, HL, 
osteoporosis status post compression fractures and 
vertebrolplasty T11-L1 presented. To ___ earlier 
today complaining of abdominal, back, chest pain starting this 
morning, very excruciating that he could not talk. CTA chest and 
CT of his abdomen was done which was negative for any aortic 
dissection, or any intra-abdominal pathology, and patient began 
complaining of severe leg weakness and numbness. Apparently this 
leg weakness began at 10 AM. He also complains of urinary 
retention and had no rectal tone.  At this point, troponin 
returned at .3 ___epressions.  Emergent MRI without 
contrast done at ___ showed acute T6 fracture with likely 
retropulsion versus epidural hematoma compressing the cord at 
that level. 

ED Course (labs, imaging, interventions, consults): 
- Initial Vitals/Trigger: 97.7 68 150/81 18 96% 4L  
EKG: His ECGs revealed RBBB and inferior Q waves (old per prior 
reports no images available) and 2mm ST depressions V4-V6 
(unclear if old or new). Given the ST changes and positive 
troponin, cards was consulted, recommended aspirin if cannot get 
heparin in the setting of epidural hematoma. 
Neurosurg: Looks like he may have mass compressing the spinal 
cord.  Needs contrast MRI, patient is likely permanently 
paraplegic, they will review the stat images, but have explained 
to patient that his likelihood of benefiting from emergent 
surgery is minimal. Does NOT recommend heparin due to 
possibility of epidural hematoma.
.
Admission Vitals: 75 120/50 14 98% 2L NC, patient chest pain 
free at the time of admission.  He is being admitted to the MICU 
for neuro checks and relative instability.
.  
On arrival to the MICU, patient complaining of severe ___ back 
pain which diminished with 1 mg IV dilaudid.

MRI Spine Non contrast: 
1. New T6  compression deformity with marrow edema probably 
extending into the pedicles  although image quality is 
suboptimal due to patient motion. Apparent space  occupying 
structure, possibly hemorrhage tracking from the T6 vertebral 
level  to the T4 vertebral level and exerting posterior mass 
effect on the cord but preserved in some of the posterior 
epidural fat. Preliminary findings discussed  
with Dr. ___.
2. Acute to subacute mild compression deformities of the L2 and  

L3 vertebrae without central canal or neural foraminal 
compromise. New L4  compression deformity since ___ but 
without evidence of marrow edema  suggesting that this fracture 
is older.  
.
MR ___ &W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 9:53 AM 
1. Compression fracture identified at T6 vertebral body with low 
signal 
intensity, no frank evidence of retropulsion is identified. This 
fracture is associated with an epidural collection, likely 
consistent with an epidural hematoma extending from T5 through 
T7 level, and impinging the spinal cord as described above.  
2. Multiple chronic compression fractures are noted at T7, T9, 
T11, T12, and L1 levels as described above. Associated 
multilevel degenerative changes. 
.
EKGs
___
EKG:  NSR with RBBB, LAFB, interatrial conduction disease and 
2mm STD V4-V6. QW III, AVF. No prior in our system for 
comparison but reports from prior at ___ (images not 
available) have RBBB and inferior Q waves.
.
___
Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. First degree 
A-V block. 
Right bundle-branch block. Inferior myocardial infarction of 
indeterminate 
age and lateral-apical ST segment depressions are suggestive of 
myocardial 
ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ premature 
atrial 
contractions are new and the lateral ST segment changes are new. 

.
___
Sinus rhythm. Prior inferolateral myocardial infarction. Right 
bundle-branch block. Ongoing ST segment elevation inferiorly 
with more prominent ST segment depression in leads I and aVL. 
There is variation in precordial lead placement in the lateral 
leads. The ST-T wave changes are consistent with ongoing 
ischemic process. Rule out myocardial infarction. Followup and 
clinical correlation are suggested. 
.
___
Sinus rhythm with slowing of the rate as compared with previous 
tracing 
of ___. There is continued evidence of active inferolateral 
ischemic 
process and continuing right bundle-branch block. Rule out 
myocardial 
infarction. Followup and clinical correlation are suggested. 
.
___
Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Probable old inferior 
myocardial 
infarction. No change compared to earlier tracings of ___ and 
___. 
.
ECHO ___
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately 
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 55%. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is 
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad. 
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Preserved biventricular 
function. Regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with CAD 
(inferior ischemia). No significant valvular abnormality. 
.
CXR ___
In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low 
lung 
volumes. Areas of opacification at the bases are consistent with 
atelectasis and effusion. There may be minimal asymmetric 
elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, more prominent on the 
right. No pneumothorax is identified. 
.
CXR ___
In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low 
lung 
volumes that may account for much of the prominence of the 
transverse diameter of the heart. There is increasing 
opacification at both bases with silhouetting of the 
hemidiaphragms. This is consistent with pleural effusions and 
compressive atelectasis. However, in the appropriate clinical 
setting, supervening pneumonia could not be excluded. 
.
CXR ___
FINDINGS: Since prior radiograph acquired over the last 24 
hours, there has not been no significant changes in the lung. 
Bibasal mild atelectasis is similar. Upper lungs are clear, and 
there are no lung opacities concerning for pneumonia or 
aspiration or new areas of atelectasis. Heart size, mediastinal 
and hilar contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with severe COPD on 3L home O2, HTN, HL, 
osteoporosis status post compression fractures and 
vertebrolplasty T11-L1 now with new T4-T6 compression fracture 
causing impingment and loss of motor and sensation below that 
level now s/p laminectomy.
.
#T6 Vertebral fracture with spinal cord compression: Presented 
to an outside hospital with paralysis and back pain. An MRI 
showed concern for epidural hematoma versus T6 fracture with 
retropulsion vs tumor/mass in the Non-con MRI and he was 
transferred here. MRI with contrast here showed compression 
fracture identified at T6 vertebral body with low signal 
intensity though to be blood clot versus tumor compressing the 
spinal cord. He was started on steroids and neurosurgery then 
took the patient to the OR and performed a T4-T6 laminectomy. 
Post operatively he regained strength and sensastion in both 
lower extremities. Final pathology ruled out malignacy. His 
steroids were weaned down to his home dose.
.
#DEMAND CARDIAC ISCHEMIA: Patient has a history of CAD with 
multivessel disease (last cath ___ with non-intervenable three 
vessel disease and deemed not a surgical candidate ___ COPD). He 
developed new ST depressions V4-V6 and elevated troponins. 
Cardiology was consulted who believed that his EKG changes and 
tropnonins were related to demand ischemia ___. 
Given concern for epidural hematoma he was not started on plavix 
or heparin iniitally. We continued his home regimen of beta 
blocker and ace inhibitor. His atorvasattin was increased to 
80mg daily. His aspirin was increased to 325 mg. Plavix was 
started on post operative day 10 (___) per neurosurgery and 
cardiology recommendations.
.
#COPD/PNA/Obstructive sleep apnea: Patient has severe COPD on 3L 
NC at baseline. We continued his advair, Fluticasone, 
montelukast, albuterol, spiriva, and IV steroids were given for 
cord compression He was intubated for the surgery and was noted 
to be difficult to extubate. After extubation he repeatedly had 
episodes of of acute SOB and hypoxia requiring Bi-PAP. He was 
treated with nebulizers, diuresis, steroids, as well as 
vanc/zosyn/azithromycin for hospital aqcuired PNA (last day 
___. He is also highly likely to have obstructive sleep 
apnea so his BiPAP/CPAP was used at nights. He will need a sleep 
study and CPAP as an outpatient.
.
#HYPERTENSION: We continued home lisinopril, metoprolol and 
Imdur. He was diuresed for his respiratory distress and his home 
furosemide 20 mg PO daily was restarted on discharge. His 
diltiazem was held for low blood pressures. 
.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___: 
. 
You were admitted to ___ for 
concerns of spinal cord compression. We performed an MRI which 
showed you had a fracture in your thoracic vertebra and our 
neurosurgeons performed a laminectomy to correct the fracture. 
The pathology did not show any evidence of cancer. Following 
your surgery, you developed respiratory distress and were 
admitted to the medical intensive care unit. It was felt that 
your respiratory distress was due to problems with your lungs 
and your heart. Multiple medication changes were made to your 
lung and cardiac medications. It was also felt that you have a 
condition called sleep apnea and were started on CPAP/BiPAP at 
night to support your breathing. Although you were started on 
CPAP/BiPAP during this hospitalization, you will need to have a 
formal sleep study to begin this therapy at home. 
. 
**Your Plavix (Clopidogrel) was stopped around the time of your 
surgery. You resumed taking Plavix on ___. Resume taking 75 
mg by mouth daily on ___. Please see below for additional 
medication changes. **
. 
The following changes were made to your medications: 

1. The frequency of your Albuterol nebulizations was increased 
from every 6 hours (four times a day) to every 4 hours. 

2. Your Aspirin dose was increased from 81 mg by mouth daily to 
325 mg by mouth daily. 

3. Your Metoprolol succinate 150 mg daily was changed to a short 
acting formulation called Metoprolol tartrate as we were 
attempting to optimize the dose of this medication. You are 
being discharged on Metoprolol tartrate 50 mg by mouth three 
times a day. Please follow up with your cardiologist regarding 
further management of this medication. 

4. STOP taking Diltiazem XR 180 mg by mouth daily. Your blood 
pressure was slightly low throughout this hospitalization so 
Diltiazem was stopped. 

5. Your Isosorbide mononitrate was increased from 20 mg by mouth 
daily to 30 mg by mouth daily. 

6. Your Atorvastatin was increased from 40 mg by mouth daily to 
80 mg by mouth daily. 

7. Start using Ipratropium bromide 0.02% solultion for 
nebulization every four hours as needed for shortness of breath. 


8. Start taking Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim 800-160mg by mouth 
every ___ and ___. This medication is to 
prevent a particular lung infection while you are on Prednisone. 


9. Please follow instructions from your rehab facility at 
discharge regarding pain medications (at the time of discharge 
from ___, your home hydromorphone and ibuprofen were held and 
you were receiving ___ mg oxycodone every 3 hours as needed).

10. Please follow instructions from your rehab facility at 
discharge regarding supplemental oxygen use at home.
 
Followup Instructions:
