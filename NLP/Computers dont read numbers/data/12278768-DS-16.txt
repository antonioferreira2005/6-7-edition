note for details. He patient received ___ antibiotic 
prophylaxis. Post-operatively, he experienced sinus bradycardia 
and was observed in the intensive care unit with telemetry. He 
was evaluated by the medical team forsinus bradycardia who felt 
the bradycardia was secondary to anesthetic medications and 
vasovagal response to surgery, sodium/potassium/magnesium within 
normal limits. On POD0, he received intravenous antibiotics and 
pyridium, maintained on bedrest and continous bladder irrigation 
overnight. On POD1, the CBI and foley catheter were 
discontinued, and he passed a voiding trial. He remained 
afebrile throughout his hospital stay.  At discharge, patient's 
pain well controlled with oral pain medications, tolerating

Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Lower urinary tract symptoms from bladder outlet obstruction

 
Discharge Condition:
Stable

 
Discharge Instructions:
No vigorous physical activity for 2 weeks. Expect to see 
occasional blood in your urine and to experience urgency and 
frequecy over the next month. You may shower and bathe normally. 
 Do not drive or drink alcohol if taking narcotic pain 
medication.  Resume all of your home medications, but please 
avoid aspirin/advil for one week.   Call Dr. ___ 
(___) for follow-up AND if you have any questions (page 
Dr. ___ at ___.  If you have fevers > 101.5 F, 
vomiting, severe abdominal pain, or inability to urinate, call 
your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room.

 

The operation you have experienced is a "scraping" operation. 
Bleeding was controlled with electrocautery which has produced a 
"scab" in the channel through which the urine passes (the 
urethra). About ___ weeks after the operation, pieces of the 
scab will fall off and come out with the urine. As this occurs, 
bleeding may be noted which is normal. You should not worry 
about this. Simply lie down and increase your fluid intake for a 
few hours. In most cases, the urine will clear. If bleeding 
occurs or persists for more than 12 hours or if clots appear 
impairing your stream, call your surgeon. Because of the 
potential for bleeding, aspirin (or Advil) should be avoided for 
the first 3 weeks after surgery.

If you develop a fever over 101Â°, chills, or pain in the 
testicles, call your surgeon. Although not common, this may 
indicate infection that has developed beyond the control of the 
antibiotics that you have taken.

It will take 6 weeks from the date of surgery to fully recovery 
from your operation. This can be divided into two parts -- the 
first 2 weeks and the last 4 weeks. During the first 2 weeks 
from the date of your surgery, it is important to be "a person 
of leisure". You should avoid lifting and straining, which also 
means that you should avoid constipation. This can be done by 
any of 3 ways: 1) modify your diet, 2) use stool softeners which 
have been prescribed for you, and 3) use gentle laxatives such 
as Milk of Magnesia which can be purchased at your local drug 
store. Remember that the prostate is near the rectum, and 
therefore, it is important for you to be mindful of the way you 
sit. For example, sitting directly upright on a hard surface, 
such as an exercise bicycle ___ cause bleeding. Reclining 
on a soft sea, or sitting on a "donut", is best. Walking (not 
jogging) is okay. You should avoid sexual activity during this 
time. Also, avoid driving an automobile. This is important, not 
because you are physically incapable of driving, but rather if 
you have an urge to urinate, it is important that you void and 
not let your bladder "stretch" too much, otherwise bleeding may 
occur. Therefore, it is OK for you to be a passenger in an 
automobile (or even to drive for very short distances).

During the second ___ week period of your recovery, you may 
begin regular activity, but only on a graduated basis. For 
example, you may feel well enough to return to work, but you may 
find it easier to begin on a half-day basis. It is common to 
become quite tired in the afternoon, and if such occurs, it is 
best to take a nap! If you are a golfer, you may begin to swing 
a golf club at this time. Sexual activity may be resumed during 
the second 3 week period, but only on a limited basis. Remember 
that the ejaculate may be directed back into the bladder (rather 
than out), producing a "dry" orgasm which is a normal 
consequence of the operation. This should not change the quality 
of sex. In general, your overall activity may be escalated to 
normal as you progress through this second time period, such 
that by ___ weeks following the date of surgery, you should be 
back to normal activity. Remember that your operation was a 
"scraping" operation and not all of the prostate was removed. 
Therefore, you should still be monitored for prostate cancer 
(assuming age and general medical conditions dictate such).

Within one week of discharge, call our office for your return 
office visit appointment which should already be scheduled.
