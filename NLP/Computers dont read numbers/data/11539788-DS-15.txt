___ NCCT
COMPARISON: CT head of ___. 
  
FINDINGS: Study is limited by motion artifact degrading multiple 
axial slices 
at the vertex and skull base. Some of the axial slices at the 
vertex were 
subsequently repeated. Despite limitations as described above, 
there is no 
evidence of acute hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally 
midline 
structures, hydrocephalus, or evidence of major territorial 
infarct. The 
gray-white matter differentiation appears preserved. The major 
intracranial 
cisterns are preserved. 
  
The extra-calvarial soft tissues are unremarkable. The 
visualized paranasal 
sinuses and mastoid air cells appear clear. 
  
IMPRESSION: Moderately limited study. While no evidence of major 
territorial 
infarct is identified, given patient's status of cardiac 
pacemaker, a CT 
perfusion is recommended if continued concern for infarction is 
present. 

___ TTE

dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___. There 
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left 
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global 
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = ___ %). The right 
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global 
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position 
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is 
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypertrophied left ventricle with severe 
global hypokinesis. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. 
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate to severe 
pulmonary hypertension. 

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable 
for review) of ___, the left ventricle is more dilated. 
The other findings are similar.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with PMHx CAD, cardiac arrest s/p ICD placement, and 
EF 20% presenting with metabolic derangements and cardiac 
arrest. Appears to have developed AFlu/Atach then became 
acidotic/hyperkalemic w/evolution to VFib that was not detected 
by ICD, possibly b/c the acidemia decreased the sensitivity. 
.
# Cardiac Rhythm: The etiology for his cardiac arrest was 
initially unclear but included hyperkalemia vs ischemic. Because 
three sets of cardiac enzymes were never elevated, it was 
believed that this was not due to ACS. After further review of 
OSH records, it was proposed that he went int atrial 
flutter/atrial tachycardia which led to hypoperfusion 
w/development of acidosis and consequent hyperkalemia leading to 
evolution into ventricular fibrillation. It was initially 
thought that his ICD did not detect this event because of 
decreased sensitivity of the leads in the setting of acidemia, 
but further evaluation by the electrophysiology team concluded 
that the ICD lead anomaly was unrelated to the incident. In his 
recent admission from 2 ___ ago, ICD interrogation showed normal 
sensing function but malfunction of the generator lead; however, 
it was not fixed because of an inability to correct his elevated 
INR. Therefore, during this admission, the goal was to correct 
the lead. In the mean time, he was maintained on his amiodarone 
and lopressor and was in NSR with his baseline LBBB.

After being transferred to the cardiology floor, ICD revision 
was planned but the patient developed thrombophlebitis of the 
right arm on the evening prior to transfer.  He was started on 
cephalexin and an ultrasound demonstrated thrombus throughout 
the course of the cephalic and in the basillic vein to the mid 
arm.  He was later sent to interventional radiology for PICC 
placement proximal to the clot but nonocclusive, soft thrombus 
was then identified in his brachial vein of the right arm.  Note 
that the left arm holds his AV fistula.  

Because the procedure could not be performed while the patient 
had an ongoing infection with possible vascular involvement, it 
was postponed until the patient completed his antibiotics.  He 
was also instructed to restart anticoagulation with warfarin.  
He will be contacted by the ___ clinic for readmission.

# CAD/Ischemia: His cardiac enzymes had an MB index of less than 
5% over three sets so he ruled out ACS. He complained of MSK 
pain over his precordium which was treated with analgesics. He 
was maintained on ASA and an ACE inbitior was initiated.  He was 
continued on his home meds (without the ACEi) at the time of 
d/c.
.
# Pump: Although clinically the patient did not complain of 
dyspnea and on physicial exam he did not have crackles nor 
peripheral edema, it was known that he had a dilated CMP. Given 
the setting of his cardiac arrest, we repeated a TTE which 
showed a stable low EF with worsening left ventricular 
dilatation and no thrombus. 

# Hyperkalemia/ESRD: His admission K was 5.7 and initially he 
was not HD as there was no clear indication. He was treated with 
kayexelate PRN over his first night and his K was maintained 
around 5.5. He underwent a mini HD session on ___ which was 
tolerated well, w/a post HD potassium of 4.9. His EKG remained 
w/o signs of hyperkalemia and he was treated with HD as per 
renal; he was maintained on his baseline renal meds. 

# Neuro: He was initially ___ but sleepy and confused, 
unaware of year, location nor president; on exam, had 
hyperreflexia and positive ___ concerning for upper motor 
neuron injury; it was unclear whether there may be a Sz 
component as father also has ?___. Neuro saw pt the night of his 
admission and felt he had diffuse encephalopathy but perhaps a 
focal lesion on R given hyperreflexia L>R. NCCT was done which 
was unremarkable. The patient had a trial of low dose diazepam 
w/decrease in myoclonus. The morning after, neuro felt there was 
improvement in the myoclonus and needed only observation.

# Anemia/INR: Has long-standing anemia likely ___ ESRD with an 
elevated MCV; Vitamin B12 and folate were normal and iron 
studies were c/w anemia of chronic disease. His Hct remained 
stable. His INR was elevated at admission to 1.8 and in his 
recent admission, it was this intractable INR that had prevented 
him from getting an ICD lead revision. He did not respond to low 
dose vitamin K. A relativelly recent US and CT of the abdomen 
had not shown any liver lesions although he did have a 
chronically elevated AlkPhos but exhibited normal albumin 
levels. Per renal, he was to begin EPO.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted because you had a cardiac arrest.  We 
ressucitated you and corrected abnormalities in your blood 
chemistries that may have caused your arrest.  While you were 
here, we also evaluated your pacemaker.  We determined that it 
will ultimately require a revision.  We also diagnosed you with 
inflammation and clots in the veins of your right arm.  For 
this, we are giving you antibiotics.  After completing treatment 
with the antibiotics, you will undergo the revision of your ICD. 
 You will be contacted by Dr. ___ within the next 
few days for scheduling.
. 
Please take all of your medications as prescribed. Please keep 
all of your follow-up appointments.  Continue taking coumadin.  
Continue taking cephalexin (antibiotic) for seven days as 
prescribed. Last day will be ___

Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you 
experience fevers, chills, sweats, chest pain, shortness of 
breath or anything else of concern.
