History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with a pertinent past medical
history of microscopia polyangiitis (pANCA/MPO+; presented as
diffuse alveolar hemorrhages and glomerulonephritis in ___ and
hx TIA and CVA (last symptomatic stroke ___ who presented on
___ with left sided weakness to ___ and was
transferred today to ___ for further management.
 
Ms. ___ was in her normal state of health (she lives alone
with her dog and is an unemployed ___) until 7:40 AM 
on
___, when she awoke from bed and noted that she was 
weak
on her left side. She found it difficult to get out of bed. When
she managed to stand, she felt that her left leg was "wobbly" 
and
she could not walk to get to the bathroom. She says that at 2:40
AM that morning she woke up and used the bathroom before
returning back to bed, and she did not perceive any symptoms at
that time. She decided to call an ambulance who transported her
to ___.

___ discharge summary, patient was noted to be
tachycardic (103 bpm),  tachypneic (RR23), and hypertensive
153-160/92-103, saturating well on room air.  Head CT was done
which demonstrated no acute pathology; chest film was done which
showed no infiltrate.  Code stroke was not called because she 
was
out of the window, but neurology was contacted.  NIHSS was 2 for
mild ataxia weakness of left arm and subjective numbness of the
left arm.  She was given 325 mg of oral aspirin.

Per patient, she was able to walk yesterday with a walker
(patient does not use one at baseline) but she still felt
"wobbly" though less so than the day before. Today, she feels
like she is regaining her strength back but she is not ___ at
her baseline.

Her prior stroke was in ___. She presented to ___ with L 
NLFF
and L UE weakness. Of note, had brief episode of diplopia 2
months before. MRI at ___ showed acute infarction in the right
putamen, corona radiata and in the left inferior caudate head. 
She had been started on aspirin during her prior ___ stroke but
it had been discontinued after diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in
___.

She notes a cough which has been present for ___ "months". She
does not currently have health insurance secondary to her
unemployment and therefore has not had a health maintenace visit
in > ___ year and takes no medications. 

She has a rheumatologist here at the ___. She attests to last
having been seen by rheumatology in early ___ after her last
vasculitis flare in ___, which was treated with 3 days of
pulse methylprednisolone and several weeks of rituximab. Per
patient, the course was stopped due to concern for ___ infection
due to immunosuppression.

On ROS, the pt endorses worsening SOB. She does not note
palpitations, but says that her HR has been faster than usual.
She denies headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia,
dysarthria, dysphagia, or vertigo. Denies difficulties producing
or comprehending speech.  Denies numbness, parasthesias. No 
bowel
or bladder incontinence or retention.

and
glomerulonephritis. Diagnosed in ___ - initially treated
with steroids, plasmapheresis and 6 months of cyslophosphamide.
Patient refused to start AZA that rheumatology had recommended
after Cytoxan. Last flare in ___

IMAGING STUDIES:

Non-Contrast CT of Head (___):
No acute intracranial process. No infarct or hemorrhage.

MRI w/o contrast (___):
- Restricted diffusion of posterior limb of R internal capsule
with T2/Flair hyperintensity compatible with a late acute to
early subacute infarction.
- Probable late acute infarct of posterior R frontal lobe.
- ?Punctate lobar foci microbleeds
- Probable chronic hemorrhagic infarcts in L external capsule 
and
non hemorrhagic chronic infarcts in basal ganglia.

Echocardiogram (___):
Normal. LVEF > 55%. No wall motion abnormalities. Trivial
(physiologic) mitral regurgitation.

Chest (PA & LAT) ___:
There is essentially no change compared to the examination from 
2 days prior.  Heart size is top normal with unfolding of the 
thoracic aorta and subtle knob calcifications.  There is mild to 
moderate right greater than left pleuroparenchymal scarring.  
Increased pulmonary interstitial markings appear similar to the 
prior examination, suggesting a background interstitial lung 
disease.  Otherwise no new consolidation is seen.  There is no 
effusion pneumothorax.  There is no acute osseous abnormality. 

CTA Chest ___:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic 
abnormality. 
2. Nonspecific diffuse multifocal ___, nodular, and 
ground glass 
opacities favor an infectious or inflammatory process.  The 
ground-glass 
component is nonspecific, though could be partially explained by 
mild diffuse 
alveolar hemorrhage, given the patient's history. 
3. Diffuse cylindrical bronchiectasis and bronchial wall 
thickening has 
progressed since ___. 
4. Small pericardial effusion. 
5. Pulmonary nodules, measuring up to 11 mm in mean diameter. 
 For incidentally detected multiple solid pulmonary nodules 
bigger than 8mm, a CT follow-up in 3 to 6 months is recommended 
in a low-risk patient, with an optional CT follow-up in 18 to 24 
months. In a high-risk patient, both a CT follow-up in 3 to 6 
months and in 18 to 24 months is recommended.

      SPECIMEN COMBINED WITH SAMPLE # ___ ___. 

BRONCHOSCOPY: ___
Airways were mildly erythematous diffusely. There were purulent 
secretions in the right middle and lower lobes, and left upper 
lobe. The right upper, middle, and lower lobe subsegments were 
inspected, without evidence of mass, mucosal lesions, or other 
abnormality. The left upper and lower lobe subsegments were 
inspected without evidence of mass, mucosal lesions, or other 
abnormality. Serial bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the 
right upper lobe apicoposterior segment with return to clear 
fluid on the first lavage, and slightly pink fluid on the 
second, findings which are not suggestive of alveolar hemorrhage 
though do not definitively exclude it. Bronchoalveolar lavage 
was performed in the right lower lobe with return of pink fluid. 
No areas of dried blood or previous stigmata of bleeding or 
alveolar hemorrhage were noted. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a history of microscopic polyangiitis vasculitis 
(pANCA/MPO), CVA (___) and several TIAs, who presented to ___ 
___ on ___ with L-sided weakness, found to have a subacute 
stroke, transferred to ___ to neurology service, found 
to have pAfib with RVR as well as bronchiectasis and multifocal 
opacities on CT Chest, transferred to medicine for further 
management. 

#Subacute stroke, posterior limb of L internal capsule  
Patient initially presented tp ___ with left sided 
weakness, transferred to ___ for further stroke work-up and 
Rheumatology co-management. Patient has a history of multifocal 
small vessel strokes back in ___. ASA had been started in ___ 
after her stroke but discontinued in the setting of Diffuse 
Alveolar Hemorrhage presentation in ___. On presentation here, 
she had mild weakness on the Left UE and ___ and ___ extensor 
plantar response on left. No facial weakness or CN involvement. 
On MRI done at ___, she found to have restricted 
diffusion of the posterior limb of left internal capsule 
consistent with new acute stroke, and L parietal subacute 
stroke. Review of imaging showed the locations of prior chronic 
infarcts, no additional microhemorrhages were noted on gradient 
echo. Regarding the etiology of her stroke, the patient as found 
to have occasional episodes of Afib with RVR (new diagnosis for 
her), suggesting a cardioembolic source. OSH ECHO was neg for 
structural abnormalities. Although patient has history of 
microscopic polyangitis, less likely due to CNS vasculitis 
because per rheumatology, would only be a concern if patient had 
extremely active rheumatologic process, which is not her 
presentation as her renal function is close to her baseline. 
Furthermore, there was no clear beading / vascular change on CTA 
to suggest vasculitis. Stroke workup was otherwise negative, CTA 
did not show significant atherosclerosis or large or medium 
vessel disease. Patient does not have notable metabolic risk 
factors. Regarding her course, L-sided weakness and ataxia with 
significant improvement here. Patient worked with physical 
therapy and discharged to home with outpatient ___. Started on 
apixaban for AF after multiple discussions of risks and 
benefits. Patient was accidentally discharged on ongoing ASA as 
well; this was an error, as patient has no indication for ASA if 
she is on apixaban. Multiple attempts made to contact patient by 
phone without response. Will continue attempting contact. I 
anticipate that the patient is probably not taking either of 
these medications due to her reluctance. Also attempted to start 
patient on atorvastatin on discharge but patient was not 
amenable to statin treatment. Hypercoagulability workup/APLS 
testing pending at the time of discharge (b2 glycoprotein, 
anticardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant).

#Paroxysmal Afib with RVR  
Patient had two episodes of acute tachycardia and felt 
palpitations. Tele demonstrated irregular rhythm with no 
distinguishable p waves and HR to 160s c/f Afib with RVR. Went 
back into sinus rhythm. Per patient, no prior history of Afib. 
ECHO negative for valvular disease. CHA2DS2VASc (stroke, gender, 
HTN) of 4, putting her at 4.8%risk per yr. ___ 
(renal,stroke, bleed) of 3. 4.8% stroke risk per year. Patient 
initially very hesitant to start anticoagulation but eventually 
was amenable to starting apixaban. Also started on metoprolol. 
ASA should be stopped - have attempted to reach patient by phone 
without success.

#Chronic cough and shortness of breath
Patient has had a cough productive of white sputum for ___ 
months, which she states has been improving. She has also had 
SOB for the past ___ weeks. ___ negative. Patient has not been 
on immunosupression since last flare in ___ when she 
presented with hemoptysis, treated with pulse methylpred and 
Rituximab, stopped when bronch sputum cx grew ___ and 
___ Psuedomonas and patient refused triple abx therapy 
at the time. Patient very hesitant to use abx use after accruing 
SEs from chronic use of erythromycin/tetracyclines for putative 
Lyme. ID was consulted to evaluate infx status especially given 
untreated ___ and Pseudomonas. Found to have extensive 
bronchiectasis and multifocal opacities on CT Chest as well as 
ESR 130. Given concern for DAH iso ?active MPA vasculitis flair, 
bronchoscopy was performed on ___ which demonstrated purulent 
secretions in the right middle and lower lobes but no strong 
evidence of alveolar hemorrhage. Thus, etiology of cough/sputum 
likely thought to be secondary to infection with either ___ 
and/or pseudomonas. Less likely due to vasculititis because per 
rheumatology, her pulmonary presentation is not consistent with 
sequelae of microscopic polyangitis. Prelim cultures (BAL+sputum 
x2) with oral flora and GNRs, still pending at time of 
discharge. Respiratory viral screen negative, quantiferon gold 
negative. HIV/HepB/HepC negative. Given stable respiratory 
function, patient discharged with plan for f/u with rheum and ID 
regarding need for abx vs. immunosuppression (e.g. rituximab). 
Per pulm recs, patient was recommended treatment for preseumed 
CAP but declined antibiotics at this time. Patient determined to 
have capacity for this and other decisions, indicating clear 
understanding of the risks and benefits in the setting of 
rational thought processes.

#renal impairment
#ANCA vasculitis  
Admitted with Cr of 1.4 (baseline 1.3 in ___. History of MPA 
presenting with glomerulonephritis in ___. Has not had renal 
biopsy in the past and wast lost to f/u with rheum and nephron 
clinics after second flare. Kidney function has been stable over 
the years with Cr and proteinuria at baseline. Sediment showing 
acanthocytes and dysmorphic red cells. Could be c/f active 
vasculitis but finding can be seen in chronic ANCA patient w/o 
flare. Renal biopsy would not be clinically beneficial at this 
time. Plan for f/u with outpatient nephrologist, Dr. ___. 
ANCA titer to assess disease activity pending at time of 
discharge.

CORE MEASURES:  
#Nutrition: Regular
#VTE prophylaxis: apixaban
#Code status: FC confirmed w patient  
#Health care proxy/emergency contact: ___ (son) 
___  
#Consulting Services: Renal, ID, Pulm, Neuro, Rheum 

Transitional Issues:
[] Pt will have follow-up with ID regarding treatment of active 
pulmonary infections, specifically NTMB, and will require 
treatment prior to initiation of immunosuppression
[] Pt started on apixaban for ongoing anticoagulation given her 
history of atrial fibrillation and stroke
[] Pt will need to establish a new primary care doctor in the 
next week when her insurance coverage is more stable, and we 
discussed the importance of this with her prior to discharge. 
[] Continue to attempt contact with patient to instruct her not 
to take ASA while taking apixaban
