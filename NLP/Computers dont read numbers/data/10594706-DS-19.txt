Chief Complaint:
Left tibial nonunion
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___: Exchange nailing, left tibial nail

 
History of Present Illness:
He is a ___
gentleman who was injured on ___ when he sustained a open
left distal tibia tibia shaft fracture.  He was repaired with a
intramedullary nail but unfortunately he is now developing a
nonunion at the mid tibia fracture plane.  It is clearly and
healed and he is already fracture one distal screw has already
been to the other one.  He will require revision for fixation.  
I
think before we do so we need to check his vitamin D and PTH and
CRP.  This is an open fracture we could be dealing with a
low-grade infection or some kind of metabolic anomaly.  I would
like to have this sorted out before we redo the tibia fracture
which will be done with re-reaming and re-nailing.
