History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ says that she has been depressed since age ___, last
felt good around age ___. She says that she doesn't like what has
happened with her life, upset about a lack of accomplishments,
mad because she doesn't respect herself. She says there are many
things going on in her life but that she does not want to talk
with me about them because she doesn't like to talk with people.
She says something has happened that made her more depressed for
the last ___ years, and for the last couple weeks she has been 
even
more depressed. She says she has been drinking to the point of
drunkenness ___ times a week to "help" her depression by making
her forget things; but she finds that the problems are back 
again
when she sobers up. Because of this drinking, she has called out
to work a few times recently and is worried that she may lose 
her
job (at times refers to herself as "unemployed," at times says
it's definitely not for sure that she will be fired). She says
initially that her mom doesn't want her back home because she
thinks she is a bad influence on her ___ autistic 
brother
who lives there too. She said she would have to stay with a
friend instead; but when I talked about hospitalization, she 
said
she was pretty sure she could talk her mom into letting her come
back home. At another time refers to herself as "homeless."

She says today she was feeling really upset about her life and
asked her mom for ibuprofen. She says she took "two handfuls,"
about ___ grams of ibuprofen. She says she started to feel a
little drowy/lightheaded, and her mom asked how many ibuprofen
she took, she she told her, and her mom called ___. Her mom 
asked
her why she was "being suicidal," and she said she wasn't "like
that." She says that she wanted to see what would happen, didn't
care if it killed her, didn't know what it would do to her and
thought "taking pills" would at least make her pass out. She 
says
she does not know if she regrets living, still doesn't want to
live her life, but denies ongoing plan/intent to harm herself.
Specifically notes that she will not stab or shoot herself.
Repeatedly downplays the significance of today's event, saying
she has "never" and would "never" do anything to hurt herself.
Says she wants to go home and shower, says we can call her and
she'll come back to get outpatient treatment.
