Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the hospital on ___ at 31w6d 
gestation for prolonged monitoring on Labor and Delivery for 
decreased fetal movement and abnormal dopplers. She was seen by 
the Neonatalogy team to discuss delivery at this early 
gestational age. On Labor and Delivery where she was noted to 
have normal range blood pressures, a tracing that was 
intermittently reactive with variable decelerations.  A repeat 
biophysical profile at the hospital was ___.  She was admitted 
with a diagnosis of hypertension of pregnancy, and she was also 
a known previa.  During her admission she received steroids for 
fetal lung maturation and continuous fetal monitoring. 
Evaluation revealed an increased ALT, so the diagnosis of 
preeclampsia was made and she was started on a 24 hour urine.  
The hope was that 48 hours could be obtained for fetal lung 
maturation.  Approximately 12 hours after admission, the patient 
began having repetitive decelerations and had a category 2 
tracing with non-
reassuring features.  A consult had been obtained with Maternal 
Fetal Medicine and jointly the decision was made that the 
patient needs to be delivered.  The patient had a known anterior 
placenta previa.  A scan immediately before being taken to the 
operating room showed the placenta took up most of the anterior 
abdominal wall, and therefore the decision was made to do a 
classical C-section, to try to enter above the edge of the 
placenta.  The patient was taken to the operating room and given 
rapid spinal anesthesia. 

She underwent an uncomplicated classical cesarean section. 
Please see operative report in OMR for full details.

On post-partum day 1, in the early morning she was noted to have 
a fever without localizing signs or symptoms. She spontaneously 
defervesced. That same morning she again had a fever  with mild 
fundal tenderness and was given the diagnosis of endometritis. 
Blood cultures were drawn and she was started on 
ampicillin/gentamicin and clindamycin. It was discovered the 
following day that her infant had blood cultures drawn growing 
listeria. Gent and clinda were discontinued and she was 
continued on IV ampicillin. She was seen by the infectious 
disease team for a consult. Her blood cultures resulted showing 
she was bacteremic with listeria, pan sensitive. A PICC line was 
placed so that she could continue IV ampicillin at home. She 
remained afebrile and stable. 

By postpartum day 5, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral 
medications. She was afebrile with stable vital signs. She was 
then discharged home in stable condition with postpartum 
outpatient follow-up scheduled.
