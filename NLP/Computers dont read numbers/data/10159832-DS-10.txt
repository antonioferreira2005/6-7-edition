SYNDROME BEST CLASSIFIED AT THIS TIME AS MYELODYSPLASTIC 
SYNDROME
WITH EXCESS BLASTS-2. SEE NOTE.
NOTE: Blasts account for 4% of aspirate differential and 4% of
the peripheral blood cells. In addition Auer rods are seen both
in some peripheral blood blasts and marrow blasts. By
CD34 and CD117 staining, blasts comprise approximately 5% of
cellularity in the core biopsy.

CYTOGENETICS
FINDINGS: An abnormal 46,XX,t(3;5)(q21;q31) female chromosome
complement with a translocation involving the long arms of a
chromosome 3 and a chromosome 5 was observed in each
of the 10 mitotic cells available foe detailed examination.
Chromosome band resolution was 400-450. A karyogram was prepared
on 3 cells. CYTOGENETIC DIAGNOSIS: 46,XX,t(3;5)(q21;q31)[10]

#Acute cholecystitis: Noted in past to have low level indirect 
hyperbilirubinemia to ~2, presumed ___. History of 
intermittent abdominal pain and vomiting with large meals c/w 
biliary colic. Presented to clinic with nausea/vomiting and

continued on meropenem 1g q8h (___). Patient's symptoms 
resolved completely post-op and there was no recurrence of 
fevers after meropenem discontinuation. 

#MDS ___/ excess blasts-2 - IPSS-R = 6 = high risk. Planning for 
allo HSCT. HLA typing performed, registry search w/ tentative 
___ unrelated donor but with DPB1 mismatch increasing GVH 
risk. Awaiting further information to confirm if additional 
___ donors are available. She has tolerated C1 and C2 
decitabine well until development of the current issue. She has 
not had circulating blasts and has good restitution of counts 
after each cycle. Patient has not been neutropenic this
