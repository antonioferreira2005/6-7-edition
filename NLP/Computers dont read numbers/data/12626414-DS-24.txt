Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with history of ETOH cirrhosis s/p ___ 
transplant ___ at ___, ___/chronic rejection and recurrent 
Child's C cirrhosis, MELD 31 on admission, presenting as direct 
admission with fatigue and malaise, with concern for worsening 
hepatic encephalopathy, improving with treatment of complicated 
UTI. 

# EtOH cirrhosis s/p ___ transplant: patient originally 
developed EtOH cirrhosis and underwent ___ transplant 
in ___. Unfortunately he developed ___ or 
alloimmune hepatitis resulting in graft 
dysfunction/liver failure and is again listed for transplant. 
Currently Childs class C, c/b new HE (presenting symptom, 
described below). EGD with 1 cord of small varices at distal 
esophagus and portal hypertensive gastropathy. The patient was 
continued on tacrolimus 0.5 mg daily, and ursodiol during the 
admission. As below, hepatic encephalopathy improved with 
treatment complicated UTI. 

# Hepatic encephalopathy: History of hepatic encephalopathy in 
the past and on recent previous admission. Full workup was 
pursued. RUQ US with dopplers which was negative for thrombus or 
other acute process. Full infectious workup was pursued 
including chest x ray, urine and blood cultures. The patient had 
no ascites amenable to diagnostic paracentesis. There was no 
evidence of active bleeding as below. The patient was found to 
have pyuria and was started on IV ceftriaxone which was 
transitioned to PO ciprofloxacin to complete a 10 day course for 
a complicated UTI. Urine culture was unfortunately contaminated, 
though patient had no history of resistant UTI in the past. The 
patient improved on antibiotics. Continued on home lactulose and 
rifaximin. The patient was alert and oriented without confusion 
on discharge. 

# Complicated UTI: Patient found to have pyuria on UA though 
aymptomatic. Urine culture contaminated though as above no 
history of resistant UTI. Started on IV ceftriaxone which was 
transitioned to PO ciprofloxacin for a total of 10 days 
(___). 

# Acute on chronic kidney disease: patient has a baseline Cr 
___ (background disease of likely chronic allograft 
nephropathy). Cr on prior discharge ___. Slightly elevated 
to 1.7 on admission. Improved with treatment of above UTI and 
transfusions for anemia as below. Had slight bump prior to 
discharge that was likely due to dehydration from being NPO for 
EGD, it remained stable at 1.6, and he will have it rechecked on 
___.

# Anemia: Baseline ___. The patient required 3u PRBC during the 
admission. There was no evidence of active bleeding or 
hemolysis. The patient underwent EGD without source to 
explaining etiology of worsening anemia. Anemia thought 
secondary to chronic disease in setting of cirrhosis and 
underproduction. The patient's H/H remained stable after 
transfusion and was discharged with H/H of ___.

# GIB/Varices: The patient underwent EGD during the admission 
with 1 cord of small varices in distal esophagus and portal 
hypertensive gastropathy. Continued on home nadolol and 
omeprazole. 

# CXR with oval ring shadow: The patient underwent subsequent CT 
without concerning findings. Finding explained by small 
loculated effusion with adjacent atelectasis.

====================
CHRONIC ISSUES
====================
# Depression: Patient continued home esciptalopram. 

# Gout: Patient continued home allopurinol with renal dosing.

# Insomnia: Patient continued home trazodone.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___. You 
were admitted to the hospital with fatigue and confusion. You 
were found to have signs of a urinary tract infection and were 
started on antibiotics. You will need to continue antibiotics 
for a total of 10 days. 

Your blood counts were also found to be low during the 
admission, and were given blood transfusions while you were here 
which you responded well to. You underwent an endoscopy which 
did not reveal any signs of bleeding. The low blood counts are 
most likely from your cirrrhosis and the fact that your body 
isn't producing as many cells as it should. 

Your medication list and outpatient appointments are listed in 
your discharge paperwork.  

It is very important you have your labs checked on ___, 
___ including your kidney function and liver labs. 

We wish you the best!
-your ___ Care team
