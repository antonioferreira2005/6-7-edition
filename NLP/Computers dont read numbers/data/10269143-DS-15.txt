___ TEE: 
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There are complex (>4mm) 
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is 
seen. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. Severe (4+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen with a primarily eccentric jet 
directed toward the septum. The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: 
Well-seated mitral annuloplasty with eccentric severe (4+) 
mitral regurgitation. Complex but non-mobile atheroma in the 
descending thoracic aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the ___ on ___ for further 
management of his mitral valve disease. He was worked-up in the 
usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound 
which showed a right internal artery stenosis of 40-59% and a 
left stenosis of 70-79%. He is edentulous and no dental 
clearnence was required for surgery. Pulmonary function testing 
was also obtained which showed an FEV1 of 57% which improved to 
70% post bronchodilation therapy. Heparin was continued for 
anticoagulation given his history of coronary artery disease and 
recent stent. A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed as 
well in preparation for surgery. On ___, Mr. ___ was 
taken to the operating room where he underwent a redo sternotomy 
with replacement of his mitral valve with a mechanical 
prosthesis. Please see operative note for details. 
Postoperatively he was take to the intensive care unit for 
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was 
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. 
Transferred to the floor on POD #2 to begin increasing his 
activity level. Gently diuresed toward his preop weight. 
On POD#3 he was started on IV heparin with bridge to coumadin 
for mechanical mitral valve. Coumadin was dosed for goal INR 
between 2.5 and 3.5. The remainder of his postoperative course 
was uneventful. He was evaluated and treated by physical therpay 
for strength and conditioning and was cleared for discharge to 
home on POD#7. Prior to discharge, coumadin followup was 
arranged with Drs. ___. INR at discharge was 3.5. 
All surgical incisions were clean, dry and intact.
