demand and average functional capacity.  He passed other
eligibility testing and began cycle 1 week 1 high-dose IL-2
therapy on ___, receiving 7 of 14 doses week 1,

of 14 doses week ___omplicated by mild
pulmonary edema.  Follow-up CT scan showed improvement in
lymphadenopathy, and he is admitted today to begin cycle 2

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This patient was admitted and went to
Interventional Radiology for central line placement.  His
admission weight was 94 kg, and he received interleukin-2
600,000 international units/kilogram, equalling 48.6 million
units IV q.8 hours times 14 potential doses.  During this
week, he received 8 of 14 doses, with dosing changed to

During this week, he developed acute renal failure with a
peak creatinine of 2.9 with associated oliguria.  He
developed mild metabolic acidosis, improved with bicarbonate
replacement intravenously.  Electrolytes were monitored and
repleted per protocol.  Urine output and serial creatinine
and bicarbonate levels were monitored.  IV fluids were
decreased given previously noted pulmonary edema.  During
this week, he had worsening transaminitis from his baseline
to a peak ALT of 199 and a peak AST of 142, both improved at
the time of discharge.  He developed hyperbilirubinemia with
a peak bilirubin of 4.2, improved to 3.5 at the time of
discharge.  He was anemic, without need for packed red blood
