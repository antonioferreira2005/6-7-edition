Pertinent Results:
ANGIOGRAM FINDINGS (___):
1.  Ectasia of the distal abdominal aorta.  This did not
appear to reach size criteria for intervention.
2.  Patent bilateral iliac artery systems.
3.  Patent left common femoral and profunda femoris artery
systems.
4.  Patent left superficial femoral artery with some degree of
stenosis in focal areas throughout the length.  None of these
appear to be greater than 50%.
5.  Patent above- and below-knee popliteal artery with several
areas of greater than 50% stenosis.
6.  Patent tibial trifurcation, with occlusion of the peroneal
artery in its distal segment and occlusion of the posterial
tibial in its midsegment.  Anterior tibial is the best runoff
vessel; however, this is occluded over a short segment in its
mid region and then reconstitutes via collateral and runs off
to a patent dorsalis pedis artery in the foot.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old Female with Left lateral ankle 
ulcer and Left foot pain who was admitted to the ___ 
___ on ___ for a scheduled 
angiogram and possible intervention. Given her history of 
chronic kidney disease, the patient was admitted one day before 
the procedure for pre hydration with normal saline 50. The 
patient was pre-oped and made NPO at midnight. On ___, 
the patient was taken to the endovascular suite and underwent 
Left lower extremity angiogram and angioplasty of Left 
popliteal, Anterior Tibial, and peroneal arteries via Right 
Common Femoral Artery access. Approximately two minutes of 
hemostasis were held with excellent hemostasis. The patient 
tolerated the procedure and was observed with serial 
examinations until the return of her pre-sedation mental status. 
For further details of the procedure, please see the surgeon's 
operative note. The patient tolerated the procedure well without 
complications and was brought to the post-anesthesia care unit 
in stable condition. After a brief stay, the patient was 
transferred to the vascular surgery floor where she remained 
through the rest of the hospitalization. The patient experienced 
some nausea following the procedure and zofran was given. On 
post-op check, the patient was stable with mild groin ooze. 
Foley catheter was removed at midnight after the procedure and 
voided without difficulties.

On ___, the patient was deemed ready for discharge, 
however, the patient was originally taking Apixaban (Eliquis) 
for DVT/PE treatment and given her creatinine clearance of <25 
(18), per pharmacy and renal service the patient was not able to 
go back to her original medication and she was given Coumadin 5 
mg and hep gtt was started as a bridge. Goal INR was of ___ 
creatine initially increased to 1.7 post-operatively, but 
recovered to 0.9 at the time of discharge. It was deemed because 
of her labile creatinine and low creatinine clearance she should 
be maintained on coumadin. She was discharged home with services 
when her INR was therapeutic. She was set up with the ___ 
clinic at ___ and her PCP was notified and agreed to manage 
her coumadin going forward.
