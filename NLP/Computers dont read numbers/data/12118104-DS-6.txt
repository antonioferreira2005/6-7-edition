Studies:

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___:  
IMPRESSION: Perihilar ground-glass opacities with 
bronchiectasis, and a more focal area of opacification in the 
right lower lobe. Findings could reflect multifocal infection, 
or drug reaction, combined with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

ECG ___:
Sinus tachycardia. Modest ST-T wave changes are non-specific. 
Since the 
previous tracing of ___ sinus tachycardia rate is faster and 
modest 
ST-T wave changes are present. 

Chest Xray ___:
Single AP portable view of the chest is obtained. There is 
persistent bilateral lung opacities worrisome for pneumonia. 
There is no significant change from prior study. There is a 
small right pleural effusion. Heart size cannot be assessed. 
Mediastinal contour is grossly stable. There is no pneumothorax. 
Right posterior upper rib fractures are again noted. 

CT chest:
1. Bilateral ground-glass opacities, new pneumatoceles, focal 
areas of 
atelectais-consolidation, Chronic mild upper lobe 
bronchiectasis, and focal air trapping as described above. 
Differential diagnosis is broad and includes infectious causes 
such as atypical viral/bacterial pneumonia including PCP, 
pulmonary edema secondary to drug reaction, chronic changes 
secondary to patient's known hypogammaglobulinemia, or collagen 
vascular disease such as goodpasture's syndrome. Exposure to 
recreational drugs might be considered as well. Overall the 
findings have progressed since the prior study obtained in 
___. 
  
2. Chronic mild upper lobe bronchiectasis and bronchial wall 
thickening may be secondary to asthma or patient's known 
hypogammaglobulinemia. 
  
3. New pneumatoceles may be sequale of prior infection or active 
infection 
such as PCP.  
  
4. Marked osteopenia with multiple stable vertebral body 
compression fractures and old rib fractures. 

Discharge labs:

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with past medical history of asthma 
complicated by multiple intubations and IV drug abuse 
complicated by septic shock and septic arthritis. She was sent 
from ___ for ED evaluation of pneumonia after her oxygen 
saturation was noted to be low.

#. Hypoxia, fevers:  She was found to have possible multifocal 
pneumonia on CXR, she was initially treated broadly with 
Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Azithromycin, which was then narrowed to 
Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone and changed to Levofloxacin and 
Cefpodoxime before dischage (planned last day ___.  Blood 
cultures were sent and are pending.  Sputum culture was 
negative.  She had a CT chest which showed ground glass 
opacities bilaterally possibly reflecting infection vs 
drug-induced lung injury.  She was treated with nebulizer 
treatments and a short course of prednisone for possible 
contribution of her underlying asthma.  Patient was originally 
started on Tamiflu but then tested negative for influenza and 
her tamiflu was stopped.  Attempted ICU consent with patient 
over course of stay however too somnolent at first and then 
refused to discuss because she wanted to eat.  It was eventually 
signed as she was leaving and at that time full code status was 
confirmed.

#. Somnolence:  She had somnolence initially on presentation 
that was thought to be related to a toxic ingestion given her 
past history of drug abuse in conjunction with verbal report 
from ED that patient went to restroom and came back to ED room 
much more somnolent.  Serum and urine tox screen were 
unrevealing, and she had no further episodes.

#. Asthma:  Patient had suboptimal air movement at presentation 
to the ICU with inspiratory and expiratory wheezing and some 
slight tachypnea. She was treated with standing albuterol and 
ipratropium nebs, her home regimen of monteleukast and advair.  
She was also treated with a prednisone taper.  It seemed that 
the patient's chronic respiratory sxs might not be due to asthma 
(overall low lung volumes and does not require chronic steroids 
like she has as a child) but to other chronic lung disease. The 
patient was presented at the pulmonary conference and she will 
need outpatient pulmonary follow-up. She was given the phone 
number to schedule an appointment.

#. Knee pain: Patient had a left knee arthrocentesis on ___ 
which showed 175/uL WBCs with 95%PMNs. Gram stain had no PMS and 
no organisms. Culture was preliminarily negative. She had no 
warmth and tenderness on exam. However, in the setting of joint 
prosthesis, she will need cautious monitoring off of antibiotic 
therapy. She was ambulatory at time of discharge and was given 
the number of infectious disease to schedule a follow-up 
appointment.

#. Opiate addiction: She was continued on a methadone taper.  
The last day was 5mg on ___.

#. Psychiatric disease: She was very demanding during this 
admission and psychiatry was consulted regarding her erratic 
behavior.  She was noted to be aggravated easily and the psych 
team felt she should have a 1:1 sitter.  She had a Code Purple 
called for aggressive and agitated behavior and was given Ativan 
and Seroquel with good effect.
