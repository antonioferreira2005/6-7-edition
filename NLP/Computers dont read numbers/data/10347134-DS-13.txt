History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o female with history of HTN, recently 
diagnosed CHF (details unclear), CAD s/p R CEA, who originally 
presented to the ___ on ___ with complaints of 
nausea, epigastric pain, fatigue, and constipation for the 4 
days prior to presentation. Her last bowel movement was 5 days 
ago, and she described it as small, hard, and black; patient had 
also recently taken Pepto-Bismol at home, but it is unclear if 
it was before or after the bowel movement. Patient reports that 
her epigastric pain and nausea have improved with Zofran over 
the last 24 hours. On further review of systems, she endorses no 
dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, edema, lighthedeadness, overt bleeding, 
or diarrhea. She does however, report an unintentional 30 lb 
weight loss over the past ___ year which she has discussed with 
her PCP. 

At ___, her LFTs, lipase, CXR, and KUB were normal without 
evidence of obstruction.  She received Zofran with temporary 
relief of her nausea, but she did have a positive troponin of 
0.13. Upon transfer to ___ NP observation unit, her 
repeat troponins were 0.04, 0.04, and 0.03. 

Her diagnosis of CHF is unclear, but OSH records refer to acute 
systolic HF ___ volume overload from IV fluids. Patient was 
recently discharged from ___ s/p recovery from a 
shoulder injury. At some point during hospitalization, she was 
told that her "heart function was 25%" and that she had had an 
MI. Of note, patient does have a complicated social situation in 
which she was recently removed from her home due to hoarding, 
neglect in adult foster home, and recent suicide attempt 1 month 
ago with overdose of ___ Percocet pills.

Patient continues to have persistent nausea, although improved, 
and she is tolerating a clear liquid diet and passing flatus.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ y/o female with history of HTN, recently 
diagnosed CHF (details unclear), CAD s/p R CEA, who originally 
presented with nausea, epigastric pain, and constipation for 5 
days. She was transferred from ___ for further 
management. 

#Nausea and epigastric pain: Patient had been having nausea and 
epigastric pain for a total of 5 days prior to admission. She 
had a history of overdosing on ___ Percocet tablets 1 month 
ago. ACS was ruled out with a stable EKG demonstrating old 
q-waves in the inferior leads, and 3 stable troponins conducted 
in-house (0.03-0.04). Etiology of her nausea and epigastric pain 
was not entirely clear. Considerations included occult 
malignancy (pulmonary nodule noted on X-ray as well as pleural 
thickening), GERD, gastritis, gastroenteritis, or 
peptic/duodenal ulcer. The patient tolerated a regular diet upon 
discharge. She had a minimal requirement for Zofran PRN while 
in-house, but was placed on Pantoprazole 40 mg PO qday in-house 
and sent home on the same dose. She was passing flatus, but had 
not had a bowel movement in 5 days. She was placed on Senna, 
Colace, Miralax, and was also given Milk of Magnesia x 1. She 
had a few loose, watery stools on the morning of discharge. She 
was also continued on her home dose of Dicylomine during this 
admission.

#Black stools: Patient had reported 1 episode of small quantity 
black stool. She also reported taking Pepto Bismol around the 
time of this bowel movement, but it was unclear if she had taken 
the medication before or after the reported "dark" bowel 
movement. There was no gross evidence of melenic stools while 
the patient was in house. She remained hemodynamically stable 
with stable hematocrit throughout admission, but may benefit 
from outpatient EGD in the event of recurrence.

#Weight loss: Ms. ___ reported a 30 lb unintentional weight 
loss for the past year, despite eating significant amount of 
fatty foods including candy, pies, etc. She may benefit from 
investigation for underlying malignancy, including age 
appropriate malignancy screening, in the outpatient setting. It 
is unclear if GI could be the primary source; however, as 
mentioned above, the findings of pulmonary nodule and pleural 
thickening on CXR at OSH, in the setting of a 69 pack-year 
history are concerning for possible pulmonary malignancy. Also, 
per patient report, she has never had a colonoscopy or EGD. 

#CAD, Troponinemia and persistent Q-waves on EKG: Patient was 
ruled out for ACS between her time at ___ and this 
admission to ___. Troponin I was elevated at OSH to 0.13, Trop 
T's at ___ 0.03-0.04. Lipid studies were within normal limits. 
EKG demonstrated q waves in the inferior leads, but was stable 
from prior EKG on ___. She was continued on her home cardiac 
medications, including Lisinopril, Furosemide, Aspirin, 
Metoprolol XL. She remained chest pain free throughout 
admission.

#HTN: Blood pressures during this admission were within normal 
limits. Her home medications, including Clonidine, Lisinopril, 
Metoprolol XL, and Isosorbide Mononitrate, were continued this 
admission.

#Compensated systolic heart failure: In the setting of report of 
recent LVEF of 25% under unclear circumstances, she remained 
without evidence of decompensated heart failure. Her cardiac 
medications were continued as above. 

#Shortness of breath: Patient did not report any shortness of 
breath this admission, and also does not carry a formal 
diagnosis of COPD. Per patient request, she was sent home with a 
nebulizer machine and nebulizers, which provide symptomatic 
relief. She is still currently smoking 1 pack per day.

#Depression: Patient was discharged from ___ on 
Citalopram in late ___. She has an unclear history of previous 
Olanzapine use. Although the patient did not endorse any current 
symptoms of depression, SI/HI, her Citalopram was continued in 
the setting of her recent suicide attempt with Percocet. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- In the setting of smoking history, unexplained 30-lb 
unintentional weight loss over the past year, incompletely 
characterized nausea and epigastric pain, and probable right 
base pleural thicking and possible right lower lobe 1.4-cm 
pulmonary nodule on outside hospital KUB/CXR, further work-up 
for systemic illness may be considered in the outpatient 
setting. 
- She may benefit from further medication reconciliation in the 
outpatient setting, given discrepancies among lists provided by 
the patient, her caretaker, and ___ 
facility; the preadmission medication list is up-to-date 
according to discussion with her caretaker. 
- Citalopram was continued, given recent addition at ___ 
___ in the context of suicidality.
- Naproxen was held, given concern for possible peptic ulcer 
disease causing nausea and epigastric discomfort.
- Opioids were held, given reports of implication in recent 
suicidality.
- Pantoprazole was added to home ranitidine, with improvement in 
epigastric pain.
- Patient was discharged on increased bowel regimen. Narcotics 
can worsen her constipation and abdominal pain, so they were 
avoided during this admission.
- A nebulizer machine was obtained and nebulizers prescribed at 
her request in the setting of presumed COPD, given extensive 
smoking history.
- It was not clear if she had been taking a potassium supplement 
while on furosemide at home and was discharged off potassium 
supplementation, given normokalemia throughout admission; she 
may benefit from reevaluation of electrolytes on follow-up with 
her primary care provider.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking part in your care during your admission 
to ___. You were transferred 
here from another hospital, where you underwent a series of 
tests for evaluation of nausea, abdominal pain, and 
constipation, including an X-ray that did not show a blockage in 
your bowels. Blood tests in the context of your evaluation were 
originally concerning for some 
strain on your heart, and you were transferred here for further 
care. Subsequent blood testing and a test of your heart's 
electrical activity (EKG) were reassuring against damage to the 
heart muscle. The cause of your nausea and belly pain remained 
unclear, but improved with antinausea medications. You may 
discuss further evaluation with your primary care doctor in the 
outpatien setting. You were constipated, so we increased your 
bowel regimen so that you were able to have a bowel movement. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
