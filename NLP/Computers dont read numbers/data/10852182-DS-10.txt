History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ homeless male with history of depression, 
alcohol use disorder, suspected korsakoff syndrome, PMHx notable 
for Atrial fibrillation, HTN, CAD with CABG ___ years ago who 
presents with suicidal ideation in the setting of homelessness, 
estrangement from his ___ year old son, and medical problems. 

The patient describes having chronic impulsive suicidal thoughts 
of hurting himself. He is unable to linearly describe how he 
presented to the hospital, last recounting that he stayed at a 
motel in ___] two days ago, did not 
know where he stayed last night, and was unable to clearly 
describe what he was doing when he last had his intrusive 
suicidal thoughts earlier today. He states he has been staying 
in hotels/motels for ___ years. His last motel was the "___ 
___" in ___, ___. He stayed there 2 nights 
ago. He is unable to tell me where he stayed last night; he 
takes awhile, then states that he took a train to get from ___ 
___ to ___. He is unable to linearly recount what 
occurred earlier that caused him to present to ___ ED. He 
states, "I guess I must have been wandering around downtown" 
when he started to have suicidal thoughts, but then later states 
he was in ___, then states he was in the ___ area 
when the suicidal thoughts were occurring. 

He explains that he gets "hijacked by these weird suicidal 
thoughts," which have been occurring for ___ years, for 
approximately ___ days/week. He believes that it is because he 
is homeless, is estranged from his family, and has still not 
fully processed his mothers death, stating that his siblings 
never told him about her death. 

He explains he's "had it" with these thoughts. He clarifies that 
he does not want to kill himself but that he does not want to 
live like this having recurring suicidal thoughts. He describes 
feeling very distressed that he is having these thoughts, noting 
that he is spending a significant amount of time thinking of 
ways to kill himself that would not involve traumatizing others 
[such as not wanting "kids building sandcastles on the shore to 
see my bloated body" if he were to drown himself in the water]. 
At the moment, he denies having active thoughts of killing 
himself. 

He endorses drinking only 2 beers earlier today prior to 
presenting to the ED. He states he spends his time wandering the 
streets, doing crossword puzzles on park benches. He explains he 
takes Zoloft from his PCP, ___, and takes it 
everyday. He does not have a current psychiatrist and states he
has not seen one since he was last psychiatrically hospitalized. 


He denies AH. He denies VH. He denies overt paranoia.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission. He was also placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted.
.
2. PSYCHIATRIC:
The patient is a a ___ undomiciled, divorced and widowed 
white male with a psychiatric history notable for chronic 
suicidality without attempts, depression, anxiety, alcohol use 
disorder, and a medical history notable for possible ___ 
syndrome, atrial fibrillation, HTN, DM, and CAD s/p 3-vessel 
CABG who self-presented to the ___ ED with worsening suicidal 
thoughts and a plan to drown himself. The patient reports being 
estranged from all of his family members including his son. He 
also reports a "lack of motivation" for the past ___ years that 
he believes underlies his chronic homelessness.
.
Diagnostically, the patient's chronic suicidality, depression, 
neurocognitive impairment (confirmed with testing in chart), 
lack of motivation, and fractured relationships all appear to be 
consistent with the long term effects of a chronic alcohol use 
disorder. The patient endorses drinking ___ drinks per day on 
___ nights per week but acknowledges that his alcohol use has 
been heavier in the past. The patient's severed family 
relationships, combined with his lack of insight into why his 
family relationships have ended, may also suggest a cluster B 
personality disorder. However, it is most parsimonious to 
attribute his relationship difficulties to the effects of his 
alcohol use disorder. 
.
Given the chronic and likely irreversible nature of the 
patient's neurocognitive symptoms, treatment options for this 
patient are limited. While the patient was in the hospital he 
was encouraged to cease alcohol use completely and consider 
going to AA in order to gain more social support around 
abstaining from alcohol. The patient's Zoloft was also increased 
from 100 mg PO daily on admission to 150 mg PO daily on 
discharge. However, the patient has not seemed to derive major 
benefit from antidepressant medication in the past, and it is 
likely that the most important intervention will be abstaining 
from alcohol.
.
The patient denied active suicidal ideation throughout his 
hospitalization, including on his day of discharge. The patient 
is strongly recommended to abstain completely from alcohol in 
the future to address his depression, his neurocognitive 
symptoms, his lack of motivation, and his social isolation.
.
3) SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER
#) Upon admission, the patient had a BAL of .33 and endorsed 
drinking ___ drinks per day on ___ days per week. He has a 
documented neurocognitive disorder. Diagnostically, the 
patient's neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms are most 
likely attributable to a chronic alcohol use disorder. The 
patient showed no signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal during 
his hospitalization. He was encouraged to stay abstinent, to 
attend AA meetings, and given multivitamin 1 tab PO daily, 
thiamine 100 mg PO daily, cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg PO daily. Upon 
discharge, the patient said he would seriously consider 
abstaining from alcohol and said he was open to attending AA. As 
mentioned above, the patient's psychiatric and neurocognitive 
symptoms are likely a result of his long-term alcohol use 
disorder. We encouraged the patient to abstain from alcohol and 
to attend AA meetings, including those available on the unit. He 
should follow up with his primary care doctor and consider 
resuming naltrexone to increase the likelihood that he will be 
able to stay abstinent.
.
4) MEDICAL
#) Hyperlipidemia: Home atorvastatin 20 mg PO Daily
#) DM: ___ was consulted and recommended that the patient's 
home metformin by increased from 500 bid to ___ bid. They also 
recommended starting glipizide 5 mg XL. The patient's HA1c was 
7.0, implying that his diabetes is reasonably well controlled; 
___ recommended dilated eye exam upon discharge.
#) HTN: Home Lisinopril 40 mg PO Daily
#) ___ venous stasis: Negative ___ ultrasounds; Home Furosemide 60 
mg PO Daily
#) Traumatic ulcer to R ___ toe: Would obtained during stress 
test. Wound care consulted.
#) Afib: Admission EKG shows sinus rhythm; Home metoprolol 
tartrate 25 mg
#) CAD: Home Aspirin 325 mg PO Daily
#) Asthma vs COPD: Albuterol inhaler 2 puff Q6H PRN

5) PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) Groups/Milieu: The patient was encouraged to participate in 
various groups and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the 
unit, and the patient declined to attend. The patient was often 
seen in the milieu and was friendly and cooperative. He was also 
found in his room reading and doing crossword puzzles.
.
#) Collateral information and family involvement - We obtained 
records from previous hospitalizations at ___ and ___ (see 
scanned documents) and collateral from patient's ex-wife. The 
patient's family is not currently in contact with him.
.
RISK ASSESSMENT AND PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself based upon his intrusive 
suicidal thoughts and plan to drown himself. His static factors 
noted at that time include chronic suicidal ideation, history of 
chronic mental illness, history of alcohol abuse, recent 
discharge from an inpatient psychiatric unit, male gender, 
Caucasian race, older age, divorced and widowed marital status, 
and chronic medical illness. The patient's modifiable risk 
factors included active substance use, active suicidal ideation 
with plan, lack of engagement with outpatient treatment, 
hopelessness, social withdrawal, limited social supports, no 
established outpatient treatment, and lack of purpose. The 
patient was discharged with several protective factors, 
including a help-seeking nature, sense of responsibility to his 
son, lack of active suicidal ideation. Overall, at time of 
discharge, patient was no longer at acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm due to decompensated mental illness.
