Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the gynecology 
service after undergoing repair of vagino-peritoneal fistula, 
laparoscopic right ovarian cystectomy, right salpingectomy. 

She first presented to ___ for right lower 
quadrant pain, fevers and abdominal pain and was found to have a 
large cyst on the CT scan. The patient had a transvaginal 
ultrasound in the ___ ED that corroborated that this is indeed 
a large adnexal cyst. She was febrile to 101.4 with chills and 
also with 2 day history of diarrhea. 

In the emergency room she continued to have fevers and was 
briefly hypotensive to 80/52, but responded to fluid 
resuscitation.  She had tenderness in the right lower quadrant 
and  voluntary guarding.  Given all these findings, it was 
concerning for ovarian torsion so the patient was consented and 
agreed to proceed to the operating room for a diagnostic 
laparoscopy with possible salpingectomy and 
salpingo-oophorectomy. 

Exam under anesthesia revealed an unexpected vaginal-peritoneal 
fistula that was 5 cm in length with a direct communication 
between the vagina into the abdomen.  On speculum exam this 
defect was found in the posterior fornix and there was no 
evidence of tissue necrosis along the edges of the vaginal 
mucosa.  This appeared to be a clean tear that was repaired 
primarily. Please see the operative report for full details.

She was started on ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin for 
24 hours afebrile given the scant amount of pus found within the 
peritoneum concerning for a peritonitis. 

Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. Immediately 
post-op, her pain was controlled with IV dilaudid. Toradol was 
held given elevated INR. 

Social work was consulted for concerns about the etiology of the 
vaginal peritoneal fistula. She denied rape/sexual 
assault/trauma. She was felt to be coping well with her surgery. 


On post-operative day 1, her urine output was adequate so her 
foley was removed and she voided spontaneously. Her diet was 
advanced without difficulty and she was transitioned to PO 
oxycodone/acetaminophen.

By post-operative day 1, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was 
controlled with oral medications. She was transitioned to 
Augmentin x 10 days (___). She was then discharged home in 
stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled.
