Chief Complaint:
RLE claudication/erythema in foot

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

 
History of Present Illness:
___AD (h/o CABG ___ and PVD admitted with RLE
claudication and erythema in foot. The patient is known to Dr.
___ recently underwent a R profunda to ___
bypass w/ NRSV in ___.  She presented yesterday (___) 
to
___ with a several month claudication of her
RLE with ambulation (less than a block) and a week of worsening
pain and some redness of her right foot.  She was admitted to 
the
OSH on the Vascular Surgery service and started on Vancomycin. 
During early work-up the decision was made to transfer the
patient to ___ given her history with Dr. ___
possible need for a CO2 angiogram (which is not available at 
___.  The patient was found to have a Cr of 3 
and
BUN of 38.  

The patient reports having RLE claudication since ___. 

She is currently seen by Dr. ___ surgeon at ___ and she reports he felt the leg could be watched 
given
that there was no change in her pulse exam.  She is seen by Dr.
___ for her history of a R CEA (performed at ___ in
___.  She has been noted to have a R carotid bruit and is due
for another R carotid U/S in early ___ as an outpatient.  
Given
her redness in her foot, she was started on ciprofloxacin by her
Podiatrist over the last month.  She has attributed recent 
nausea
to the cipro and has since discontinued.  She reports no
improvement in her redness with the antibiotic.

OSH admission course is notable for elevated SBP's up to the
200's.  The medical team consulted increased her home amlodipine
dose from 5 mg to 10 mg, and her Coreg dose was increased from
12.5 mg to 25 mg PO, and she was also ordered for nitro paste as
needed.  Also of note, during her initial evaluation GI also
consulted for a reported ___ month history of post-prandial
nausea and emesis and early satiety.  She has reportedly lost up
to 30 lbs in this time-frame.  The GI team felt she would need
further work-up, including endoscopy but the work-up could be
delayed until her vascular issues were addressed.

Pertinent Results:
___ CXR: There is cardiac enlargement and mild pulmonary edema, 
as manifested by  pulmonary blood flow re-distribution and mild 
interstitial markings. There also are fluid markings of the 
interlobar fissures, as evident on the lateral image. The 
lateral image also reveals rupture of the lowest sternal wire. 
No pleural effusions. No pneumonia. No pneumothorax  

___ TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild 
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
akinesis of the basal ___ of the inferior wall and 
hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall. The remaining segments 
contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests 
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). 
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free 
wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending 
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild-moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation directed towards the interatrial septum. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion.  

___ Non-invasive arterial studies
FINDINGS: The right ABI is likely artificially elevated from 
calcified 
vessels, measured as 1.2. The left ABI is therefore likely 
unreliable, measured as 0.62. Pulse volume recordings show some 
dampening of bilateral ankle and significant dampening at 
bilateral metatarsal levels. The arterial Doppler waveforms 
demonstrate on the right side, triphasic signal in the common 
femoral and monophasic to triphasic signal in the popliteal with 
monophasic signal in the posterior tibial, dorsalis pedis and 
digital waveforms could not be identified. On the left side, 
there is a triphasic signal in the common femoral with 
monophasic signal in the popliteal and dorsalis pedis. Posterior 
tibial on the left side could not be identified. 
CONCLUSION: 
RIGHT SIDE: No definite inflow disease. Difficult to quantify 
degree of  arterial insufficiency in the setting of 
noncompressible vessels, though given the absent waveform in the 
dorsalis pedis, suspect severe tibial level disease, 
preferentially affecting the dorsalis pedis. Study of the bypass 
graft the same day demonstrated diminished flow in the profunda 
femoris artery upstream of the graft as well as narrowing at the 
proximal anastomosis of the graft which in part is likely 
responsible for these findings. 
LEFT SIDE: No significant inflow disease. Moderate left leg 
arterial insufficiency likely on a basis of SFA/popliteal 
disease and tibial level disease. The posterior tibial artery 
cannot be identified. 

Graft Duplex ___
CONCLUSION: Patent bypass graft from the right profunda femoris 
to the  posterior tibial artery, however, with a tardus parvus 
waveform in the native vessel prior to the graft and an 
approximately four-fold velocity elevation across the proximal 
anastomosis. A less than two-fold elevation is noted across the 
distal anastomosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ___ vascular surgery service 
on ___ for evaluation and treatment of RLE claudication and 
right foot erythema. She was started on vancomycin. Per the labs 
on transfer from the outside hospital, the patient was found to 
be in heart failure and arrived with a Cr of 3.0. Cardiology and 
nephrology were consulted. On ___, the patient underwent a 
TTE (see results section for details). She also received 
non-invasive vascular studies, duplex of the vein graft, and 
vein mapping (see results section for details). Vascular surgery 
decided that she did not need a surgical intervention and 
transferred her on ___ to medicine for management of her 
heart failure and renal failure.

# Acute on chronic systolic CHF: BNP was ~40,000 at the OSH. An 
echo was performed on ___ and showed an EF 40%.  She came in 
quite volume overloaded on exam, and very dyspneic on exertion.  
She achieved adequate negative fluid balance with her home dose 
of lasix 80mg, and her dyspnea and physical exam improved. She 
was continued on her beta ___, and statin, and fluid 
restricted. However her Cr began to rise, suggesting 
overdiuresis, and her lasix dose was ultimately reduced to 60mg 
PO daily on discharge with improvement in her renal function. 
Cardiology followed her during her stay and their 
recommendations were followed.
 
# Acute on chronic renal failure: On arrival, her Cr was 3.0. It 
was unclear what her baseline Cr was; per her primary 
nephrologist Dr. ___ had not had labs checked in at 
least a few months, before which her baseline was in the 2s. Her 
Cr began to worsen over the last 3 days before discharge, and 
her lasix dose was reduced with stabilization in her Cr. On 
discharge, it was 3.4. The renal service followed her during her 
stay and their recommendations were followed. They recommended 
not to restart her ACE-I while her renal function was 
fluctuating, and would defer this decision to her outpatient 
nephrologist. 

# Toe ulcer: By history, it began as a purulent ulcer with 
surrounding erythema before her admission. When she was 
admitted, the vascular surgery service placed her on 
vanc/cipro/flagyl from ___ - ___. There was no evidence 
of osteomyelitis on plain film. When she was transferred to the 
medicine service on ___, it appeared that her infection had 
resolved. Her antibiotics were discontinued and she was observed 
to have a stable dry ulcer with no spreading erythema or 
tenderness. She did have mild patches of erythema on the dorsum 
of her foot, which she said chronically waxes and wanes with no 
tenderness.
 
# Diabetes mellitus: A1c was 8.7 on ___.  Home regimen is 
70/30 15 units BID.  In the hospital, her sugars were 
fluctuating quite a bit and she was initially on a different 
insulin regimen each day on the vascular surgery service. Upon 
discussion with her PCP, it was felt that she would have 
difficulty adhering to an insulin sliding scale. The decision 
was made to resume her home regimen, and she will need follow-up 
with her PCP to discuss any changes to her regimen.

# HTN: On admission, she was severely hypertensive in the 200s. 
Upon diuresis and resumption of her amlodipine and carvedilol, 
her blood pressure was reduced to the 150s-160s. The renal 
service recommended a target blood pressure of 150s-160s to 
prevent hypoperfusion of her kidneys, as she likely has a higher 
baseline than normal. They also recommended starting hydralazine 
and imdur to control her blood pressure, deferring the decision 
to restart her ACE-I to her outpatient nephrologist once her 
renal function stabilizes.

At the time of discharge, the patient was at her baseline 
ambulatory status, was tolerating PO, and voiding independently. 
She was able to verbalize understanding with the discharge plan 
and instructions.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,
  
It was a pleasure to take care of you at ___. You were 
admitted for evaluation of your toe ulcer and leg pain, but was 
also found to have significant fluid overlaod from heart failure 
and renal failure. You were initially on the vascular surgery 
service, but they determined that you could not undergo any 
surgical intervention due to your heart and kidney function. You 
were started on antibiotics for your toe ulcer, which appeared 
to improve and currently shows no further signs of infection. 
You were then transferred to the general medical service. You 
were given lasix until your heart failure improved. You were 
also seen by our nephrologists who, in conjunction with your 
outpatient nephrologist, made adjustments to your hypertension 
medications and monitored your kidney function.

You do not need any further antibiotics at the moment, but if 
you develop more redness, pus, fever/chills, or pain, please 
contact your primary care doctor or go to the emergency room for 
evaluation.

Also seek immediate medical care if you develop:
- fever/chills
- shortness of breath
- chest pain
 
Followup Instructions:
