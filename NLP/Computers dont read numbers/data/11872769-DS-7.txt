Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ yo M with a PMHx of CKD (baseline creatine of 
1.3-1.5) DM-2 who presents to ___ with a prodrome of upper 
respiratory symptoms and purulent discharge from ears, tinnitus 
and occipital and neck pain, found to have right otitis media 
and otitis externa, a perforated right TM and acute on chronic 
renal failure 
.
#Acute Renal Failure on Stage 2 CKD
The patient p/w acute illness and ARF which is likely due to 
hypovolemia.  His urine lytes were drawn and they indicated a 
FENA well below 1 (0.3), indicating a pre-renal cause to his 
ARF.  As a result he was aggressively hydrated with IV fluids 
and his creatine returned to his baseline of 1.5 on the day or 
discharge.  Due to the patient receiving multiple antibiotics, 
we also checked urine eosinophils, which were negative.  The 
patient UA showed some pyuria without evidence of bacteria.  His 
urine culture also returned negative so no further work up was 
done.  He should have a follow up BUN and creatine prior to his 
visit with his PCP ___ ___ weeks. 
.
# Acute Sinusitis causing Otitis Media and Otitis Externa
The patient likely had a prodromal viral vs. bacteria infection 
causing swelling and decreased draining from the inner ear.  As 
a result, otitis media, TM perforation and subsequent otitis 
externa resulted.  The patient is at increased risk due to his 
DM.  Cultures of his purulent fluid from his ear were never sent 
in the ED.  The patient was seen by the ENT service who 
recommended cipro/dex ear drops, systemic treatment with 
Augmentin, nasal flushes and follow up with them in ___ weeks.  
The patient was initially started on Unasyn and narrowed down to 
Augmentin with continued clinical improvement.  The patient did 
not show consistent pain in the mastoid area and the clinical 
suspicion for mastoiditis was low.  The patient was sent home on 
a short course of morphine ___ (40 tabs dispensed) for pain 
control and a bowel regimen.  An exhaustive effort was made by 
myself and the nursing staff to secure the patients 
prescriptions.  Mass health does not cover cipro ear drops, the 
only fluoroquinolone they cover is ofloxacin (which does is not 
anti-pseudomonal).  As a result, the patient was dispensed 
enough Cipro and dexamethasone ear drops to last until his 
follow up with ENT.  The patient should also follow dry ear 
precautions, per ENT's instructions.       
.
#Vocal cord abnormality
This was noted on ENT's physical exam, and the patient should 
follow up with them for further assessment of this
.
# Type 2 Diabetes controlled with complications
The patient metformin was held until the patients renal function 
improved and it was then re-started prior to d/c.
.
# Transitional Issues:
-The patient has pending blood cultures from ___ which need 
follow up
-The patient should follow up with ENT in ___ weeks for routine 
follow up following hospitalization for AOM, OE and acute 
sinusitis and the vocal cord abnormality
-The patient should follow up with his PCP ___ ___ weeks with a 
repeat BUN/Creatine and blood pressure check as his blood 
pressure was borderline high and with DM may merit starting a 
anti hypertensive medication.
.
.
4. Benign Hypertension
- will defer antihypertensives to his PCP unless it becomes very 
uncontrolled
