Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency department and was 
evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found 
to have left tibia and fibula fracture and was admitted to the 
orthopedic surgery service.  Upon being transferred from the ED 
to the floor, the patient was noted to have an aphasia and was 
urgently rushed to CT scan to rule out intracerebral hemorrhage 
and dissection--results of which were negative.  Neurology 
recommended EEG monitoring due to her history of bleeding 
cerebral aneurysms and she was noted to have abnormal activity 
coming from the area of her previous bleed which correlated to 
seizure-like activity for which she was subsequently started on 
Keppra. The patient was taken to the operating room on ___ 
for left tibia intramedullary nail, which the patient tolerated 
well. For full details of the procedure please see the 
separately dictated operative report. The patient was taken from 
the OR to the PACU in stable condition and after satisfactory 
recovery from anesthesia was transferred to the floor. The 
patient was initially given IV fluids and IV pain medications, 
and progressed to a regular diet and oral medications by POD#1. 
The patient was given ___ antibiotics and 
anticoagulation per routine. The patient's home medications were 
continued throughout this hospitalization. The patient worked 
with ___ who determined that discharge to home was appropriate. 
The ___ hospital course was otherwise unremarkable.

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the 
patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is 
touchdown weight bearing in the left lower extremity, and will 
be discharged on Aspirin for DVT prophylaxis. The patient will 
follow up with Dr. ___ (___) per routine. A thorough 
discussion was had with the patient regarding the diagnosis and
