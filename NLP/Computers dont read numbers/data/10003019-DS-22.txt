# ECHO ___
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is 
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Posterior MVP suspected but not 
clearly seen.. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature 
of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly 
underestimated (Coanda effect). The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could 
not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable 
for review) of ___, no definite change.

IMAGING
# CXR ___
FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 Left basilar 
atelectasis is seen.  There is left basilar and left mid lung 
atelectasis/scarring.  Chain sutures are noted overlying the 
right 
upper-to-mid hemithorax.  There is subtle focal patchy opacity 
projecting over 
the right lateral lower chest, which in the same location on the 
lateral view, 
appeared to be a linear opacity dating back to ___.  
Finding could 
represent atelectasis/scarring; however, on the current study, 
it appears more 
amorphous and a small focus of infection is not excluded.  The 
cardiac and 
mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is no pleural 
effusion or 
pneumothorax.  There is persistent moderate compression of 
multiple vertebral 
bodies including at least two mid thoracic and at least two in 
the 
thoracolumbar region, similar to the prior chest x-ray. 
# CXR ___
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___: 
  
Multifocal pulmonary consolidation is clearing.  Heart is normal 
size.  Right 
paratracheal mediastinal fullness, due in part to adenopathy is 
longstanding.  
No pleural effusion.  Heart size normal.  Right jugular line 
ends in the 
region of the superior cavoatrial junction. 
# CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ___
FINDINGS: 
  
Aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal in diameter.  The right 
central venous 
line tip is at the level of right atrium.  No appreciable 
mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy is seen.  Within the limitations of this 
non-enhanced study, 
there is no evidence of hilar or axial lymphadenopathy.  No 
pericardial or 
pleural effusion.  Increased density of the myocardium as 
compared to the 
blood in the chambers of the left ventricle is consistent with 
anemia. 
  
Airways are patent till the subsegmental level bilaterally. 
Right upper lobe 
scarring is unchanged with volume loss and slight bronchial 
distortion.  Left 
upper lobe scarring is unchanged.  Pulmonary nodules scattered 
throughout the 
lungs are all stable with no new pulmonary nodules, masses or 
consolidations 
to suggest infectious process. 
  
There are no lytic or sclerotic lesions worrisome for infection 
or neoplasm.  
Multiple compression fractures are redemonstrated and can be 
seen at least 
back on ___ chest radiograph.  No new lesions seen. 

  
The imaged portion of the upper abdomen reveals no appreciable 
abnormality. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.  No evidence of new pulmonary abnormalities to be attributed 
to neutropenic 
fever. 
  
2.  Unchanged appearance of the chronic changes related to known 
sarcoidosis. 
  
3.  Status post splenectomy.  Evidence of anemia. 
  
4.  Multiple compression fractures of the thoracic spine, 
gallstones, 
unchanged. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with h/o Hodgkin's lymphoma C1D17 ABVD, sarcoidosis, 
OSA on CPAP, h/o AVNRT, presented with neutropenic fever and 
SVT.

MICU Course:  
============
Pt. was initially admitted to the MICU for hemodynamic 
instability requiring pressors (levo) in the setting of presumed 
neutropenic fever and sepsis.  Pt.'s hemodynamics quickly 
improved once starting cefepime/vancomycin with fluid 
resuscitation.  He was also noted to have a downtrending 
lactate.  He was quickly weaned off of pressors and transferred 
to the floor.

Floor Course:
=============
# Neutropenic fever, no clear source identified: p/w T102.2 at 
home, initially met ___ SIRS criteria. lactate 3.2 on admisison, 
resolved s/p fluid resuscitation. fever quickly resolved the day 
after admission. vanc/cefepime d/c'd ___ and ___, respectively, 
without new fever. Pt finished a course of levofloxacin for 
community acquired pneumonia, also w/o recurrence of fever and 
no futher pulmonary symptoms.  Course notable for new 
leukocytosis with watery diarrhea, c. diff ordered, but no BM 
since. stool culture negative, O&P negative. Leukocytosis likely 
related to underlying malignancy. Culture with negative 
respiratory virus studies, negative urine culture, Blood cx 
NGTD.  CT negative for pneumonia. 

# AVNRT: Pt presented with reported (ED EKG not recovered) 
SVT/AVNRT to 130s with decreased BP x 2, spontaneously resolved 
in the ED.  Has h/o 2 AVNRT per ___ cardiology consult note. 
  At that time they did not suspect cardiac sarcoid as a 
causative agent, based on TTE/EKG. Catheter-ablation was 
discussed but pt declined and pt not currently a candidate given 
immunocompromised state. Beta-blockers were advised; pt did not 
respond to esmolol gtt in ED. Initial cardiology impression was 
that the tachycardia may be more related to presentation of 
SIRS. Pt was noted to have another episode of AVNRT during the 
hospital stay with HR to 140.  The AVNRT once again 
spontaneously resolved. Pt was restarted on home dose of 
metoprolol in short-acting forms once pt's BP improved with no 
further episodes of AVNRT noted.

# Port placement c/b bleed - pt received port placement ___. He 
was noted to have oozing from dressing site post procedure day 
1. Prophylactic dosing of heparin was discontinued given 
isolated PTT elevation.  His PTT normalized.  Pressure dressing 
was placed on the port site.  Interventional radiology 
re-examined the port and noted small bleeding vessel underneath 
the port, which was cauterized by ___. Pt was monitored for 
24hours afterwards with no re-bleeding.  Port was ok to access 
per ___.
 
# Hodgkin's Lymphoma: stage IV. admitted in C1 of ABVD .Most 
recent PET CT scan on ___ showed 1) hilar, mesenteric, and 
RP LAD; 2)New scattered FDG-avid foci in the liver and pancreas. 
3) New focus of FDG-avidity in the L2 vertebral body. Received 
D1 of C1 of ABVD on ___. Immuran stopped and PSE dose 
reduced to 30mg/day from 40mg/day. ___: PSE dose reduced to 
25mg/day, but increased to 30mg/day on ___. PFT obtained, which 
showed reduced diffusing capacity. Bleomycin was therefore held. 
 ECHO was obtained with good EF and no wall motion 
abnormalities.  Pt received AVD in house prior to discharge. Pt 
was continued on Fluconazole 400 mg PO Q24H, Acyclovir 400 mg PO 
Q8H, and Sulfameth/Trimethoprim SS 1 TAB PO DAILY for 
prophylaxis.

# Normocytic Anemia: Hct stable this am. No gross signs of 
bleeding on transfer to floor. decrease in hct initially may be 
related to dilutional effect in the setting of fluid 
resuscitation - though pt did not experience similar decrease 
his other cell lines.  Pt remains asymptomatic in regards to his 
anemia. no dizziness/light headedness or palpitation.  His 
hgb/hct remained stable and did not require transfusion.

# Sarcoidosis: thought to involve skin, gut, eyes and lungs, and 
presumed neurosarcoidosis in the form of headaches. Followed by 
rheumatology and pulmonary service for ___ years. In this time, 
he has been off steroids only for ~1 month.  s/p stress dose 
steroid in the ED for possible iatrogenic adrenal suppression in 
the settingn of hypotension. Pt was restarted on prednisone 30mg 
PO daily, and remained stable on regimen.

# Depression: no SI/HI on admission. stable on home Fluoxetine 
40 mg PO DAILY
