Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain, shortness of breath
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___: Impella removal
___: 
1. Coronary artery bypass graft x 5. Total arterial 
revascularization.
2. Skeletonized left internal mammary artery sequential grafting 
to diagonal and left anterior descending artery.
3. Skeletonized in situ right internal mammary artery graft to 
obtuse marginal artery.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a is a ___ year old man with past medical history of 
hyperlipidemia and hypertension. He presented to presented to 
his PCP with ___ three day history of shortness of breath and 
palpitations. An ECG was notable for <1mm elevation in V4, V5 
prompting ED evaluation. He reported that his symptoms have been 
coming and going for three days. He states that they came on 
while driving. He denies relieving factors. He reported that 
while exercising yesterday he developed additional fatigue and 
shortness of breath. He was referred to his local ED and was 
found to have an elevated troponin. A cardiac catheterization 
revealed multivessel disease and an occluded LAD. This was 
thought to be the culprit lesion but due its ostial location a 
stent was thought to be dangerous. An Impella was placed and the 
patient developed a groin hematoma that improved with a 
Fem-Stop. He was transferred for cardiology and cardiac surgery 
consult.

Reports:
==================
Transthoracic Echocardiogram ___
There is suboptimal image quality to assess regional left 
ventricular function. The visually estimated left ventricular 
ejection fraction is 35%. The Impella catheter is correctly 
positioned with respect to the aortic valve. There is no 
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Limited study. Moderately depressed left ventricular 
systolic function with suggestion of relative hypokinesis of 
anterior, anterolateral, inferolateral segments, and true apex, 
however suboptimal image quality precludes adequate assessment 
of extent of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Impella 
catheter tip within acceptable distance range, however in some 
views it appears that it may be abutting the papillary muscles.

Carotid Ultrasound ___
Right ICA 0% stenosis with mild intimal thickening. Left ICA 0% 
stenosis.

Transthoracic Echocardiogram ___
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. There is 
normal left ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity 
size. There is normal regional left ventricular systolic 
function. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low 
normal. Quantitative biplane left ventricular ejection fraction 
is 51 % (normal 54-73%). Left ventricular cardiac index is low 
normal (2.0-2.5 L/min/m2). Global longitudinal strain is 
depressed (-13 %; normal less than -20%) There is Grade I 
diastolic dysfunction. Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity 
with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is 
normal for gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for 
gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a mildly dilated 
descending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. There is trace aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. 
There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve 
leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is mild to
moderate [___] tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial 
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: 1) Mild global LV systolic dysfunction with mild 
regional variation in contractilty suggesting either diffuse 
cardiomyopathic process or CAD with ischemic stunning in LCX 
(significant post-systolic contraction suggests viability and 
stunning rather then myocardial
infarction - see bull's eye colored in blue). 2) Mild to 
moderate tricuspid regurgitation in setting of mild RV dilation 
with normal free wall function.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to ___ on ___ and was transferred to the 
CCU for further care. He was rapidly weaned from Impella support 
and the device was subsequently removed. Cardiac surgery was 
consulted for revascularization. He underwent routine 
preoperative testing and evaluation. He had an access site bleed 
in the right groin and arrived with a Femstop in place. He 
maintained good distal pulses throughout the stay, and 
definitive hemostasis was achieved at the time of Impella 
removal. He presented with a creatinine of 1.5 from an unknown 
baseline. He remained stable and was taken to the operating room 
on ___ and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 5. 
Please see operative note for full details. He tolerated the 
procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. 
 
He weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was 
extubated on POD 1.  Beta blocker was initiated and he was 
diuresed toward his preoperative weight. He remained 
hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the telemetry 
floor for further recovery. He was evaluated by the physical 
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. By 
the time of discharge on POD 4 he was ambulating freely, the 
wound was healing, and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. 
He was discharged home in good condition with appropriate follow 
up instructions.
