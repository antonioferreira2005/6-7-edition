Chief Complaint:
hip pain

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a ___ year old woman with stage IVb endometrial cancer 
with metastasis to bone complicated by recent right hip and 
femoral shaft fractures s/p hemiarthroplasty ___, left hip 
arthroplasty ___, and excision and curettage metastasis in the 
pelvis on ___, DM, OSA, morbid obesity, bipolar disorder, 
complicated diverticulitis s/p colostomy, who was admitted from 
___ clinic due to concern for abscess.

Briefly, she initially presented in ___ with left hip pain 
and found to 
have pathologic fracture of left acetabulum and new lytic lesion 
on CT, eventually diagnosed to be metastatic from endometrial 
adenocarcinoma on bone biopsy. She then underwent planned left 
hip tumor resection and total hip arthroplasty in ___, course 
complicated by blood loss anemia requiring a total of 14 u prbc. 
Following discharge to rehab, patient was readmitted in ___ 
for concern for cellulitis around her abdominal surgical 
incision. SHe was treated with vancomycin 1g q8hr. CT scan at 
that time on ___ did show fluid collections in the surgical 
field along the left iliac wing and within the left inguinal 
region. As cellulitis showed significant improvement, no 
surgical 
intervention was undertaken. Had been planned for IV vancomycin 
via PICC (placed ___ until ___. On subsequent ___ clinic 
visits, she has been noted to have continued erythema on left 
lateral body extending from LLQ and back over left hip surgical 
site to left mid thigh. Her vancomycin was extended for 2 more 
weeks. However on repeat CT on ___, she was again noted to have 
increased sizes of multiloculated abscesses in the region of the 
left hip with increased size of right retroperitoneal lymph 
node, likely reactive. THese findings were reiviewed with 
patient at her ___ clinic appointment on ___, ___ and 
ortho-onc was contacted and pt was given 1L IVF, cultured and 
direct admitted to ___. Her last dose of vancomycin was given 
this morning and she will not be due for the next dose until 
tomorrow.   

On arrival to floor, she reports ongoing pain at surgical site, 
also reports chills at home, mild nausea. Denies documented 
fevers, increased ostomy output, chest pain, shortness of 
breath.

CT Abd/Pelvis ___
1. Mildly increased sizes of multiloculated abscesses in the 
region of the 
left hip, as described above, with increased size of right 
retroperitoneal 
lymph node, likely reactive.  ___ consider consult with 
interventional 
radiology to assess feasibility for drainage. 
2. Re-demonstration of loss of fat plane between the sigmoid 
colon and the 
anterior bladder wall with air seen within the bladder, 
concerning for 
colovesicular fistula. 
3. Persistent hypodense endometrium, which is abnormal in a 
postmenopausal 
patient.  ___ consider further evaluation with pelvic 
ultrasound. 

___ - US INTERVENTIONAL PROCE
Successful US-guided aspiration of a subcutaneous collection 
around the left iliac crest.  Sample sent for microbiology 
evaluation. 

Femur XR ___
Comparison to ___.  There is a new partial fracture 
of the right femoral shaft, visualized on 2 of the available 
projections, located at the level of the lowest of the 5 
cerclages.  At the level of the right hip as well as the 
displayed parts of the left lower extremity, there is no 
evidence of fractures. 

US MSK Hip ___
Persistent subcutaneous anechoic fluid collection measuring up 
to 4.4 cm 
located anterior to the left hemipelvis with overlying 
subcutaneous edema. 

US INTERVENTIONAL PROCE ___
Successful US-guided aspiration of a subcutaneous fluid 
collection around the left iliac crest.  310 cc straw-colored 
fluid was removed.  A sample was sent for microbiology 
evaluation. 

CXR ___
In comparison with study of ___, there is little change in 
the 
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, degree of pulmonary 
vascular 
congestion, and left pleural effusion with compressive 
atelectasis at the base. Although no definite focal 
consolidation is appreciated, in view of the extensive changes 
ascribed above, it would be very difficult to unequivocally 
exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a 
lateral view. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old female with past medical history of 
diabetes, obesity, stage 4B endometrial cancer with multiple 
___ metastases complicated by pathologic fractures s/p R hip 
hemiarthroplasty and L hip arthroplasty, the latter complicated 
by surgical site infection admitted ___ with failure of 
medical therapy, now status post ___ guided drainage of abscess, 
now clinically improving able to be discharged back to rehab

# Surgical Site Infection
# Abscess L leg
# Complication of L hip replacement
Patient with recent hospital stay for post-operative 
complications after L hip replacement, including soft tissue 
abscess and cellulitis at surgical site, who was referred for 
admission with increasing erythema and imaging raising concern 
for fluid collections that were increasing in size and 
concerning for multiloculated abscess.  Ortho onc evaluated the 
patient and did not recommend surgical intervention. On ___ and 
___, ___ performed aspiration of L iliac crest fluid collection, 
with subsequent clinical improvement.  Patient initially on IV 
vancomycin, subsequently narrowed to oral clindamycin, with plan 
to complete course of antibiotics on ___.  At time 
discharge, L hip exam showed residual induration, but without 
pain or fluctuance, per ID felt to be residual resolving 
inflammation vs related to malignant disease (and not active 
infection). 

# R femoral fracture, closed 
On plain film of R femur, completed as part of post-operative 
check, she was incidentally found to have "new partial fracture 
of the right femoral shaft, visualized on 2 of the available 
projections, located at the level of the lowest of the 5 
cerclages." Patient was seen by orthopedics service who 
recommended against any surgical intervention.  Patient should 
remain partial weight bearing on R leg--they will arrange for 
outpatient orthopedic surgery follow-up.  

# Nocturnal Hypoxia
# Obstructive sleep apnea 
Patient with reported history of OSA, not on CPAP, noted to have 
intermittent episodes of nocturnal hypoxia.  Would consider 
outpatient evaluation for CPAP.  

# Endometrial cancer
Per oncology patient started on anastrozole daily.  Patient 
scheduled for outpatient onc follow-up. 

# Diabetes type 2
Reduced her lantus regimen given episode of hypoglycemia; 
continued humalog sliding scale. 

# Depression
# Bipolar disorder
Continued bupropion, clonazepam, Risperdal, and sertraline. 

# Glaucoma
Continued Latanoprost 

# Hypothyroidism
Continued Levothyroxine 

# Question of CHF
Per history, has a question of CHF in the past.  Would consider 
of outpatient workup to confirm/deny this and to guide 
consideration of appropriate management 

Transitional Issues
- Last day of PO clindamycin = ___
- L hip with residual induration, but without pain or 
fluctuance, per ID felt to be residual resolving inflammation
- Incidentally found R femoral fracture, as above, for which she 
should remain partial weight bearing on R leg and have 
outpatient ortho follow-up 
- Insulin dosing decreased this admission due to hypoglycemia
- Per primary oncologist, was started on anatrazole here
- Per history, has a question of CHF in the past.  Would 
consider of outpatient workup to confirm/deny this and to guide 
consideration of appropriate management 
- Recent outpatient CT scan showed "Re-demonstration of loss of 
fat plane between the sigmoid colon and the anterior bladder 
wall with air seen within the bladder, concerning for 
colovesicular fistula." Can consider outpatient workup/referral.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___: 

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  You were admitted
