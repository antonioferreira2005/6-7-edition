History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ male w/ hx emphysema, T2DM, TBI,
quadriplegia, chronic decubitus ulcers, recurrent bowel
obstruction and colonic dysfunction s/p subtotal colectomy with
end ileostomy ___ who presented on ___ from home with
failure to thrive. Admitted to inpatient for placement at rehab.

He was recently discharged on ___ after an admission for fecal
discharge from rectum. 

He returned to home (lives alone) with services, but over the
last week, it became clear that ___ cannot meet his needs. Per
the patient, ___ was coming twice daily initially but only able
to come at 4PM at the latest; given that he gets many nighttime
medications, he felt it was unacceptable that he was being
administered his nighttime medications at 4PM. He reports that
the ___ then reported that they were not able to continue to 
care
for him, thus prompting this presentation.

Otherwise, he reports no fever, new abdominal pain, chest pain,
difficulty breathing. His ostomy output is normal. He has been
eating well without difficulty.

In the ED:
- Initial vital signs were notable for:
T 97.9 HR 80 BP 128/79 RR 16 O2 Sat 99% RA

- Exam notable for:
Abdominal/GI: Soft, mildly tender diffusely, liquid/green ostomy
output
Otherwise unremarkable

- Labs were notable for: No labs done
- Studies performed include: No studies done
- Patient was given: Home medications
- Consults: 
-- Case management: Patient declined a bed offer at rehab so 
will
require inpatient admission for placement

Vitals on transfer: 
T 98.2 HR 87 BP 126/79 R R19 O2 Sat 96% Ra

Upon arrival to the floor, he reports that he feels the same as
he did at discharge from his most recent hospital stay. He is
upset as he has been in the ED bed for over 2 days and reports
that his back is very sore. He requests an air mattress.

He is also frustrated because he had not been able to get into
the rehabs that he wants. He reports case management downstairs
offered him a "one star rehab" and that ideally he would like to
get into ___ Extended Care. Per ED case management, he
declined 3 rehabs based on Medicare rating.

Regarding his hospital stay, he was admitted here from ___
for fecal incontinence from his rectum and increased ostomy
output. Initial CT A/P was concerning for enterocolonic fistula
but a repeat CT A/P on admission showed no evidence of fistula.
There was no evidence of infection or bleed on multiple ostomy
cultures. (Workup revealed C diff negative, bacterial stoo
cultures negative, guaiac negative). It was thought he may have 
a
possibly viral infectious colitis or enteritis. Gradually his
ostomy output decreased ans his rectal output resolved. He
resumed his home medications n discharge.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Complete ROS obtained and is otherwise
negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ]The patient has a blind pouch remaining of his rectum and 
sigmoid colon that does not communicate with his functioning 
ileum. However, there is chronic calcified stool in this remnant 
pouch that may leak out intermittently over the years to come. 
The calcified stool cannot be reached by disimpaction and 
surgery does not recommend any intervention for it. This leakage 
should be monitored and cleaned to avoid irritation of patient's 
sacral ulcers but otherwise does not require intervention.
[ ] Intermittently with hypomagnesemia this admission. Would 
recheck BMP in 7 days and consider supplementation as needed.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Failure to thrive
Patient presented from his rehab facility for failure to thrive. 
He refused rehab placement in ER and was subsequently admitted 
for placement. Case Management conducted bed search during 
admission; patient and family were agreeable with the facility 
choice. 

# Ileostomy s/p colectomy: 
# Residual/chronic calcified stool leakage
Usual ostomy care was continued. Ostomy and rectal output both 
guaiac negative. Patient had no concerns of ostomy output during 
admission but noted small stool leakage from rectum. 
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted. Continued home 
loperamide: changed from 4mg BID:PRN (admission dose) to ___ 
BID:PRN, based on pt's home regimen. Continued home 
diphenoxylate and atropine: changed from 1 tab BID:PRN 
(admission dose) to ___ tab BID:PRN, based on pt's home regimen. 
Prior CT scans were reviewed with radiology and discussed with 
colorectal surgery team.  Pt has a blind pouch remaining of his 
rectum and sigmoid colon that does not communicate with his 
functioning ileum. However, there is chronic calcified stool in 
this remnant pouch that may leak out intermittently over the 
years to come. The calcified stool cannot be reached by 
disimpaction and surgery does not recommend any intervention for 
it.

# Chronic unstageable sacral decubitus ulcer:
Followed chronically by wound care for sacral ulcers. Patient 
has bilateral gluteal ulcers with erosions and scant bleeding 
but no clear evidence of infection. Likely exacerbated by fecal 
incontinence. Patient was repositioned regularly. His wound was 
evaluated and monitored. Wound care consulted and provided 
recommendations; patient prefers to dictate his own wound care 
regimen. Air mattress was obtained to relieve pressure on 
ulcers.

# Iron deficiency anemia
Baseline Hgb ___. Prior Iron studies were consistent with iron 
deficiency, with ferritin 13. This is likely in setting of slow 
bleeding from sacral ulcer, with no clear evidence of GI 
bleeding (guaiac negative from ostomy and rectal output). He 
received IV iron on the last admission x4. Hgb and iron studies 
were rechecked and were substantially improved from prior - Hgb 
was stable from 10.4-10.8 during this admission, improved from 
Hgb of ___ last month. Continue to monitor every ___ months as 
outpatient.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Spastic quadriplegia due to TBI:
# Contractures of upper extremities:
# Chronic pain:
# Possible seizure disorder:
Patient has history of quadriplegia resulting from remote TBI, 
with chronic, severe contractures of his upper extremities 
bilaterally. Per prior records, no prior history of seizures, 
but started on Keppra ___ due to history of "time skips" and 
post-ictal state. Continued home baclofen, tylenol, diazepam, 
keppra, and oxycontin. 

# Insulin-dependent T2DM:
A1c 8.6% ___. Continued home lantus, glipizide and ISS. Patient 
stated he no longer takes metformin, discontinued during 
admission. Patient also stated his home ISS starts at FSBG of 
150 but doesn't recall ISS units; ISS determined by ___ 
during last admission was continued during admission.

# COPD/Possible asthma: Not on O2 at home. No evidence of 
exacerbation. 
- Continued home advair

# HLD: 
- Continued home Cholestyramine

# BPH: 
- Continued home Tamsulosin

# GERD: 
- Received Omeprazole in place of home dexlansoprazole (NF); 
will restart home dexlansoprazole upon discharge.

# Depression: 
- Continued Home venlafaxine (also for neuropathic pain)

# ___ edema: 
- Continued home torsemide
