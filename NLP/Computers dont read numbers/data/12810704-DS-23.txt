EGD ___:  Findings: Esophagus:  
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted.  
Stomach:  
 Mucosa: Erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in 
the antrum and pre-pylorus. These findings are compatible with 
gastritis. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at 
the Stomach .  
Duodenum:  
 Mucosa: Erythema of the mucosa was noted in the duodenal bulb 
compatible with duodenitis.  
Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Erythema in the antrum and pre-pylorus compatible with gastritis 
(biopsy)
Erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis.  
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 
Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results
Follow up per inpatient GI team recommendations.  Avoid all 
nsaid usage
Findings do not explain patient's gastrointestinal bleed. 
Consider capsule endoscopy within the next 2 weeks to further 
evaluate the small bowel.
Discuss with cardiology if patient needs to remain on plavix.  
Start protonix 40mg once a day given gastritis. 
Additional notes: The attending was present for the entire 
procedure. The patient's home medication list is appended to 
this report. FINAL DIAGNOSIS are listed in the impression 
section above. Estimated blood loss = zero. Specimens were taken 
for pathology as listed.

___: EGD BIOPSIES FINAL PATH PENDING
___: CAPSULE ENDOSCOPY PENDING
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo M with coronary artery disease status 
post coronary-artery bypass surgery (on plavix) and with melena 
and bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) manifesting as slowly 
decreasing hematocrit over the past ___ months.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Gastrointestinal bleed: Initially presented with melena and 
BRBPR which had been occuring on and off for several months.  
His hematocrit had dropped to the ___ from the ___ in ___.  He 
was not having abdominal pain.  He had a history of similar 
episodes of bleeding which resolved when he stopped plavix.  GI 
was consulted and they performed an esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy 
(EGD) only found gastritis and duodenitis.  This was unlikely to 
the cause of such a large drop in hematocrit.  Thus, he was also 
evaluated with a capsule endoscopy the following day to look for 
a small intestinal source of the bleeding.  These results are 
not reported yet.  He will follow-up with GI on ___.   He 
was started on pantoprazole 40 mg po daily and also his plavix 
was held indefinitely to avoid repeat GI bleed.
.
# Acute blood loss anemia: His hematocrit (Hct) has been 
trending down from a baseline of 40 in ___.  MCV is normocytic 
to slightly microcytic, consistent with an anemia of blood loss. 
 He responded to transfusion of 4 units pRBCs with Hct up to 28, 
which is not entirely appropriate rise but he passed melanotic 
stool x 2 overnight observed. Two repeat hematocrits 8 hours 
apart remained stable after completed bowel prep for capsule 
endoscopy.  
.
# Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Patient has a significant 
cardiac history, however, in the setting of GI bleed he was 
instructed to hold his plavix.  His last stress test was ___ 
with an LVEF of 46%.  Also, his stents were placed > ___ years 
ago, which does not necessiate continued plavix in this patient 
who might have greater risk of continued GI blood loss.  His 
cardiologist, Dr. ___, was notified and he will follow-up 
with him to discuss this further.  He was continued on ___, 
lisinopril, imdur, metoprolol.  He is not taking a statin 
because he has a history of statin-induced myopathy.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Hyperlipidemia: He was continued on his cholestyramine.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please follow-up the results of the capsule endoscopy and 
refer Mr. ___ for appropriate further management
- Please follow-up the results of EGD biopsies
- Please recheck a hematocrit at follow-up to ensure that he is 
no longer bleeding
- Please discuss the risk of further anticoagulation with plavix 
versus GI bleeding

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
.
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having GI 
bleeding.  You underwent an upper endoscopy and a capsule 
endoscopy.  You were found to have irritation in your stomach 
and upper intestines.  
.
Your levels of red blood cells were low when you came in and you 
were having symptoms from this including shortness of breath, 
decreased endurance/exercise tolerance, and weakness.  You 
recieved 4 units of blood and your symptoms improved.  Your 
blood counts stayed stable over an 8 hour period.
.
The following changes were made to your medications:
- START taking protonix 40 mg daily
- STOP taking plavix
- STOP taking ibuprofen, this can irritate your stomach.  You 
can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain instead.  The maximum 
dose of Tylenol is 4000 mg per day.
.
It is very important that you keep all of the follow-up 
appointments below.  It was a pleasure taking care of you in the
