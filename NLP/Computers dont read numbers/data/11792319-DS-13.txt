IMAGING

Plain film pelvis (___): 1. Non-displaced fractures of the 
inferior pubic rami bilaterally. 2. Non-displaced fracture of 
the left superior pubic ramus. 3. Minimally displaced fracture 
of the right sacrum. 

CT abdomen/pelvis (___): 1. Bilateral inferior pubic rami 
fractures, left superior pubic ramus fracture, and right sacral 
ala fracture. 2. Small amount of blood in along the pelvic 
sidewalls, anterior to the bladder, and in the presacral space. 
3. Thickening cecum and adjacent lymphadenopathy, very 
concerning for malignancy.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with PMH of HTN and glaucoma who presents from OSH with 
pelvic fracture.

ACTIVE ISSUES

# Multiple pelvic fractures: Due to mechanical fall. Evaluated 
by Orthopedics and surgical intervention is not indicated. 
Admitted to Medicine for pain control. Patient's pain was 
controlled with standing Tylenol. She did not require oxycodone 
but did take Tramadol for further pain control though she 
complained that it made her sleepy. Physical therapy was 
consulted and recommended rehabilitation placement.

# Leukocytosis: Resolving. Most likely in the setting of pelvic 
fracture. Leukocytosis stabilized at ~11. 

# Anemia: Hct 32.4 on admission. Unclear baseline. Concern for 
acute blood loss anemia in the setting of her multiple pelvic 
fractures or iron-deficiency anemia from probable colon cancer. 
Iron studies showed mixed picture, both iron deficiency and 
anemia of inflammation. Hct stable on discharge without active 
signs of bleeding.

# Cecal thickening: Found on CT abdomen/pelvis. Very concerning 
for malignancy per final report. Discussed with patient. 
Recommended colonoscopy for further evaluation. Patient elected 
to discuss with PCP as outpatient. PCP's office also notified of 
CT scan findings and concern for malignancy.

CHRONIC ISSUES

# Hypertension: Continued home lisinopril and amiloride.

# Glaucoma: Continued home timolol and latanoprost.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were a patient at 
___. You came to us with a 
pelvic fracture after your fall. Our orthopedic surgeons 
recommended physical therapy and rehab. We are sending you to a 
rehab facility so that you can build up your strength and heal 
your fracture.

While you were here, we got a CT scan of your abdomen and 
pelvis. This showed some bleeding from your pelvic fracture. It 
also showed some thickening in the first part of your colon that 
is concerning for a tumor. Please discuss colonoscopy with your 
PCP, who we informed of these results while you were here. 

We wish you all the best.
