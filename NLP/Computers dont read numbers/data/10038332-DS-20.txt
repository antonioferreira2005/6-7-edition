Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old male with a history of T10 
paraplegia, neurogenic bladder & recurrent UTIs, recent 
pre-admission question of paranoia/psychosis, who presented with 
syncope multiple times daily. Patient reported losing 
consciousness up to 5x/day daily for months. All work-up was 
unremarkable. EEG showed mild encephalopathy but no seizures. CT 
head and C spine showed mild cervical spondylosis. Orthostatics 
negative. Telemetry without events. Patient reported that he had 
no episodes of syncope in the hospital and none were witnessed. 
Psychiatry evaluated the patient and diagnosed schizophrenia 
with psychosis exacerbated by drug and medication use (cocaine 
and Concerta) and started the patient on Risperdal. Syncope was 
felt to be psychiatric in nature, however history also notable 
for significant caffeine intake in addition to ADHD medication 
and severe insomnia. 

ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
============================

#SYNCOPE: 
Unclear etiology. Never witnessed by the patient's family and 
has not had any events during this hospitalization. No history 
of seizures. Question of whether this was a case of psychiatric 
syncope which typically presents in younger patients with 
psychiatric disorders, without cardiovascular or neurologic 
disease. Another consideration was drug/med effect from opiates, 
other illegal drugs given that the patient's urine tox was 
positive for opiates (on MS ___ and cocaine. The patient 
emphasized how little he sleeps (stays up late playing video 
games, watching TV, often only gets ___ hours of sleep a night), 
and somnolence secondary to this was felt to be a contributing 
factor as well given that the patient had no episodes in the 
hospital and was well rested here. Also endorsed drinking 
multiple caffeinated drinks daily in addition to ADHD 
medication. Not felt to be cardiac or neurogenic as ECG, 
telemetry and EEG showed nothing except for mild encephalopathy. 
Ultimately felt when discharged that this would continue to 
resolve with improved psychiatric care as outlined below.

#PSYCHOSIS with suspected schizophrenia: 
Based upon rambling and disorganized speech in addition to 
delusions of the government following him confirmed by his 
family. He also previously endorsed paranoia and visual 
hallucinations. Per psych likely chronic and then triggered by 
cocaine (and possibly other drug) use and Concerta. UTI felt to 
have contributed to the patient's decompensation as well. 
Thyroid function appeared normal (TSH was low but barely below 
low normal limits and free T4 was well within normal limits) so 
hyperthyroidism was felt much less likely. Additionally he had 
no other physiologic symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The patient's 
morphine was tapered since he violated his narcotics contract 
and his home Concerta was held indefinitely. His UTI was treated 
as noted below and he was started on risperidone  QHS per psych. 

***** He recently fired his PCA on ___ (who was helping with 
ADLs, food, meds) because he thought she was not helping much 
and just taking his money. He and his son on discharge were 
setting up his son as his new PCA. He was also set up  with a 
partial day psych program in order to expedite his outpatient 
psych care, given difficulty getting him a psychiatry 
appointment because of the patient's insurance. 

#CYSTITIS/prostatitis as below
Patient reported cloudy urine. Self caths due to neurogenic 
bladder ___ spinal cord injury from gun shot wound. UA was 
grossly positive. Urine culture grew ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII 
sensitive to Bactrim and ENTEROCOCCUS SP. sensitive to 
ampicillin. His antibiotic course was as follows:
- Ampicillin PO 500 mg Q6H (___)
- Bactrim DS BID (___)
- Empiric ceftriaxone (___)

#Acute bacterial PROSTATITIS: 
Tender on digital rectal exam, performed on day of discharge 
with concern given recurrent UTIs and reported bladder 
discomfort. Discharged on Bactrim x 6 weeks for prostatitis 
___ - ___ given senses on initial culture. Counseled 
on clean self-cath routine. 

# L hallux ___ trauma - patient stubbed toe with skin 
tear. Recommend ongoing dressing changes daily and monitoring 
for improvement. 

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
============================
 
#DEPRESSION:
- Continued Wellbutrin

#ADHD:  
- Discontinued Concerta and did not resume on discharge as noted 
above  

#CHRONIC PAIN:
- Continued gabapentin. 
- Morphine taper (15 mg twice daily from ___, then 15 mg 
daily from ___ the patient had diarrhea when this 
was initially held. Patient violated his narcotics contract 
prior to admission with illicit drug use. 

#CHRONIC ISSUES:  
- R gluteal wound: daily dressing changes  
- Neurogenic bladder: continued home tamsulosin, mirabegron, 
methenamine  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
============================
- Anti-psychotic medication management (Risperdal started in the 
hospital) and psych follow up
- Partial day psych program intake scheduled for ___ at 9 am
- Gluteal wound care and left toe wound care with home ___
- Bactrim x 6 weeks for prostatitis (___)
- Taper down MS ___ (15 mg twice daily from ___, then 
15 mg daily from ___ because patient violated narcotics 
contract
- Son will be patient's new personal care assistant
