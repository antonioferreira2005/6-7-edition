___ ABD/PELVIC CT W/CONTRAST:
1. Multiple fluid density structures, some loculated with rim 
enhancement most likely represent innumerable metastatic 
deposits. These are seen in the liver, implanted on the liver 
surface. omental, site of prior Whipple, duodenum, right adrenal 
(and probably left), pelvis, and probably right 
inguinal hernia. 
2. Metastatic deposits at the right hepatic flexure cause 
dilatation of the cecum, and likely a partial obstruction. 
Another deposit in the left pelvis likely causes partial 
obstruction also. 
3. Right pulmonary nodule concerning for new pulmonary 
metastasis.

___ Pathology Report Tissue: SIGMOID COLON:
DIAGNOSIS: 
Sigmoid colon, partial resection (A-O):
1.  Adenocarcinoma extensively involving mesentery, subserosa, 
and bowel wall with focal extension into bowel mucosa (see 
note).
2.  Diverticular disease.
3.  Metastatic carcinoma present in 2 of 8 regional lymph nodes.

Note: The features are morphologically similar to those of the 
previously resected pancreatic ampullary carcinoma (___). 
 The involvement of the mesentery and bowel wall is consistent 
with metastasis.

Clinical: Large bowel obstruction.
Gross:  The specimen is received fresh in a container labeled 
with the patient's name "___, the medical record 
number and additionally labeled "sigmoid colon".  It consists of 
a segment of colon that measures 16 cm in length and 3.5 cm in 
diameter.  A portion of mesentery is attached to the colon that 
measures 13 x 5 x 2 cm. The specimen has one open end and one 
stapled end. The mesentery is remarkable for a palpable firm, 
shaggy area measuring 7.5 cm in length, located 2.5 cm from the 
open end. This area appears to have been involved by adhesions. 
The serosa of the bowel is involved by the thickened firm, 
shaggy area measuring 7.5 cm in length. The remainder of the 
serosa is smooth. The specimen is opened along the 
antimesenteric surface to reveal fecal material and an area of 
thickened mucosa with narrowing of the lumen. This area appears 
to contain diverticula with associated  abscess formation.  No 
masses or polyps are identified. The remainder of the mucosa is 
tan with normal folds. Diverticula measure up to 1.4 cm in 
thickness.  Within the mesentery, multiple potential lymph nodes 
are identified. The specimen is represented as follows:  A=open 
margin, B=stapled margin, C-H=area of thickening with abscess 
formation, I=area of another potential diverticula, J=normal 
mucosa, K-O=potential lymph nodes.
