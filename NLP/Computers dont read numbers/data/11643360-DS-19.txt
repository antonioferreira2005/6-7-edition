___ ABD CT:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Gallbladder appears distended and slightly edematous, which 
is nonspecific but may reflect acute cholecystitis in the 
appropriate clinical presentation. 
2. The liver demonstrates mildly low attenuation suggestive of 
hepatic 
steatosis. 
3. Scattered colonic diverticulosis without evidence of acute 
diverticulitis. 
4. Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis versus 
aspiration. 

___ ABD US:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Cholelithiasis is seen in a mildly distended gallbladder with 
a sliver of pericholecystic fluid/gallbladder wall edema, which 
is not seen on the prior exam from ___ and can be 
concerning for acute cholecystitis. 
2. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease and more advanced liver disease including 
steatohepatitis or significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot 
be excluded on this study. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient with h/o cholelithiasis was admitted to the Acute 
Surgical Service on ___ for evaluation and treatment of 
abdominal pain.  Admission abdominal ultra-sound and 
abdominal/pelvic CT revealed acute cholecystitis. The patient

well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note 
for details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the 
patient arrived on the floor tolerating clears, on IV fluids and 
antibiotics, IV Dilaudid for pain control, and JP drain to bulb 
suction.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.
Pain was well controlled. Diet was progressively advanced as 
tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability on POD 1. The 
patient voided without problem. During this hospitalization, the

respiratory toilet and incentive spirrometry, and actively 
participated in the plan of care. The patient received 
subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this 
stay.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled. The patient was discharged home wit services for 
drain care. He was discharged on PO Augmentin secondary to 
gangrenous cholecystitis. The patient received discharge

Mr. ___,

following instructions.

incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages
