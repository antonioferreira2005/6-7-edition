Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your admission to ___ 
___.  You were admitted for 
evaulation of cough and low blood pressure.  Your cough is 
likely a post-viral cough.  You have no signs of an acute

pressures improved with IV fluids.  The low blood pressures 
likely occurred due to taking your blood pressure medications in 
the setting of decreased food/liquid intake.  Your blood 
pressure medications (hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril) were 
stopped while you were in the hospital.  You should not restart 
these until you follow up with your primary care physician, ___. 
___.  In addition, it is recommended you drink plenty of 
fluids when you return to home.  Should you develop fever or
