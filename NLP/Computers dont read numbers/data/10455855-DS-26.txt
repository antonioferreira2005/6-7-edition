IMAGING/OTHER STUDIES:

CXR ___: FINDINGS:  There is cardiomegaly as well as a 
pacemaker with leads terminating in appropriate position.  There 
are new interstitial opacities consistent with edema.  No focal 
opacities concerning for infection.  No pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with history of DM2 (A1C 6.9), CKD, HTN, HL and 
multiple prior UTI's who presented to the emergency department 
after an episode of unresponsiveness at home, found to have 
hypoglycemia and acute on chronic renal failure.  

# Hypoglycemia: Likely secondary to poor oral intake and insulin 
combined with a sulfonylurea. Given patient's recurrent episodes 
of hypoglycemia, her glyburide was stopped during this 
admission. She was continued on her previous regimen of 12u 
glargine qHS. She will have close followup with the ___ 
___. 
 
# Acute on chronic renal failure: This was almost certainly 
prerenal azotemia in the setting of decreased PO intake. Cr 
returned to baseline with IV fluids.

================================================================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

#Hypoglycemia: Glyburide was discontinued during this admission. 
Given recurrent episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia, patient 
may benefit from slightly looser glucose control goals. She was 
discharged on home dose of 12u glargine qHS which may need to be 
adjusted.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for low blood sugars (hypoglycemia) 
and worsening kidney function. You were given sugar through the 
IV and you began eating and your sugars came back to normal. We 
will stop your diabetes medication, glipizide, to help prevent 
episodes of hypoglycemia in the future. It is important that you 
have juice or other sugar containing snacks around in case you 
begin to feel that your sugar is dropping.
Your worsening kidney function was likely caused by dehydration 
and improved back to your baseline with IV fluids. You should be 
sure to keep well hydrated at home to help protect your kidneys.

It was a pleasure taking part in your care and we wish you a 
speedy recovery!
