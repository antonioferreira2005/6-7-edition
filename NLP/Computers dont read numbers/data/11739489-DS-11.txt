History of Present Illness:
This is an ___ man with hx atrial fibrillation, PPM for
CHB, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, CAD status post MI,
seizure disorder, severe persistent asthma, temporal meningioma,
who presents for evaluation of respiratory symptoms,
hyponatremia, aphasic episodes.  So a lot of ___ 
nodes
usually like that I mean I do not know if he can also when I was
ability like everybody-always ___ likes each but that is
more like a long term effect but I do not know if it can also
cause

The patient is had about 10 days of chest congestion and cough
that began after an episode of choking while eating. However, 
the
cough is continued. He has been fatigued and weak. His wife
reports that he has been slightly confused, and they measured a
T-max of 100.4. Due to these symptoms, the patient presented to
___ urgent care today; at that visit, his sodium 
was
noted to be 125, and in light of his prior seizure disorder, he
was referred to the ED for further evaluation.

Of note, the patient was recently seen in our emergency
department for evaluation after a fall. A noncontrast head CT 
did
not reveal any acute process. He had a laceration above the left
eyebrow that was sutured.

Otherwise, he has a history of resected meningioma with an
associated partial seizure disorder. His wife states that over
the last few days, his gait is been slightly unsteady, and that
he has been having episodes of around ___ seconds of aphasia
without any other focal neurologic deficits.  However, this is
not her primary concern regarding the changes that he has had 
for
the past few days, and she wonders why ___ so focused on 
this
specific symptom.

She states he had a temperature to ___ yesterday, otherwise
does not think he has had any fevers, chest pain, abdominal 
pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria.

She also notes that he had an episode of hematuria in the
emergency department, which he has never had before.

ACUTE ISSUES 
============
# Pneumonia
# Aspiration 
Patient had witnessed episode of aspiration about 10 days prior 
to admission. He then sytemic symptoms as well as shortness of 
breath. He was seen by speech and swallow and was not felt to be 
aspirating, but likely is just eating too fast. He was initially 
started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP. He was given 
ceftazidime for one day. He was then transitioned to Unasyn on 
___ and continued a 5 day course of azithromycin. He was 
transitioned to Augmentin to complete a course of antibiotics on 
___. 

# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy 
Initial concern the patient was either experiencing TIA, stroke, 
or breakthrough seizure based on reports of 15-second aphasic 
episodes, however per further discussion with his wife this is 
not far off of his baseline. His progressive lethargy over days 
prior to admission was probably secondary to infection and 
hyponatremia. His mental status improved to near his baseline 
with treatment of these, however he would likely benefit from a 
neurocognitive evaluation as an outpatient. 

# Hyponatremia 
He appared euvolemic with elevated urine sodium and osms most 
consistent with SIADH in setting of pulmonary illness and 
possibly AED. His oxcarbazepine was down-titrated as he was 
started on lacosamide. He subsequently had an improvement in his 
serum sodium. 

# Seizure disorder 
Neurology was consulted in the emergency department given 
initial reports of aphasic episodes. Given his hyponatremia, 
they recommended tapering off of his oxcarbazepine and starting 
lacosamide as replacement. He tolerated this well without any 
recurrence of seizures. His oxcarbazepine was decreased to 300 
mg TID and then 150 TID for 3 days (___). It should be 
stopped on ___ and at this point lacosamide can be increased 
to 150 daily. He continued his Keppra at his former dose. 

# GPC growing in blood culture
Per Micro lab, ___ bottles from ___ growing 2 species of GPCs.
One appears to be consistent with alpha-hemolytic strep and
another may be coag-negative staph. Suspect likely contaminants. 


# Hypertension 
On a complex regimen of losartan, hydralazine, amlodipine, 
diltiazem, HCTZ and minoxidil at home. These were held on 
admission with concern for potential decompensation. His 
losartan, hydralazine, and diltiazem were all added back prior 
to discharge. 

# Atrial fibrillation
He continued his home apixaban and management of diltiazem as 
above. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
# CAD status post MI 
He continued his home atorvastatin. 

# OSA on home BiPAP 
He continued his home BiPAP. 

# Glaucoma 
He continued his home meds. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ] He will complete a course of Augmentin on ___. 
[ ] He would benefit from outpatient neurocognitive testing to 
assess his baseline level of cognitive impairment. 
[ ] Several of his home antihypertensives were held upon 
discharge (amlodipine, HCTZ, and minoxidil). Please assess his 
blood pressure and add these back as needed.
[ ] He was hyponatremic, please check a BMP on ___. 
[ ] Please continue oxcarbazepine 150 mg TID ___ and 
then STOP. 
[ ] Please increase lacosamide to 150 mg twice daily on ___.
