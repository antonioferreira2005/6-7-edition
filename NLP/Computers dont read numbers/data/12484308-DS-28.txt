Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
___ male with PMHx alcoholic cirrhosis, alcohol abuse 
complicated by withdrawal seizures, asthma with multiple 
intubations in the past, and chronic pain on methadone 
presenting with abdominal pain and SOB.

# Abdominal pain-- Pt reports mid-epigastric pain on 
presentation radiating to back and flanks.  CT a/p performed in 
ED negative for any acute processes or signs of acute 
pancreatitis.  Very mild elevation in lipase.  This was felt to 
be more likely alcoholic gastritis rather than acute on chronic 
pancreatitis.  It was managed conservatively with bowel rest and 
initially IV dilaudid which was transitioned to PO after pt 
tolerating diet.  PO dilaudid was also subsequently tapered and 
pt was discharged with a 2 day supply for any ongoing 
breakthrough pain.

# EtOH w/d-- ___ was monitored on CIWA and initially required 
several doses of 4mg PO ativan which was tapered to 2 mg, 1 mg 
and subsequently off as pt was no longer showing signs of 
withdrawal.

# SOB/Asthma exacerbation--  Pt presents with SOB and is very 
wheezy on exam with poor air movement.  Unclear trigger for 
asthma exacerbation but suspect possible ?aspiration event in 
s/o recent ETOH intake.  ___ reports medication compliance but 
this may have also been a precipitating factor.  He was started 
on a prednisone burst, azithromycin, and given duonebs with 
improvement.

# Opiate dependence-- Per reports, pt with long history of 
hydromorphone use/abuse with issues in the past with getting 
discharged from methadone clinics.  Currently, he is at Habit 
OPCO and was continued on 80mg methadone.  Pt expressed 
significant discontent with his pain medication regimen while 
inpatient.  However, it was felt to be unsafe to escalate 
regimen more than 0.5mg IV dilaudid q4H initially as he was also 
getting his outpatient methadone in addition to Ativan.  Staff 
also found him to be frequently somnolent despite reports that 
his pain was poorly controlled.

# Elevated Transaminases--  Mildly elevated AST, Alk phos in 
900's.  Alk phos has been significantly elevated in 800's in the 
past.  MRCP was done last admission in ___ and this did not 
show an intra- or exta-hepatic biliary duct dilatation or 
masses.  Alk phos remained elevated throughout his stay but his 
AST/ALT downtrended.

# Cirrhosis-- home lasix and spironolactone were held initially 
as pt had poor PO intake.  He remained euvolemic despite holding 
these medications and they will be resumed upon discharge.

Transitional Issues:
[ ] ___ with chronic cirrhosis with e/o varices and splenomegaly 
on recent imaging.  Consider EGD for evaluation of degree of 
varices after discharge and to evaluate for chronic gastritis as 
cause for recurrent episodes of epigastric abdominal pain.  Also 
need to consider nadalol and PPI for prophylaxis pending results 
of EGD

Billing: Greater than 30 minutes were spent on discharge 
coordination and counseling.

Abdominal pain

Asthma exacerbation
Opiate dependence

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.

Discharge Instructions:
You came in with abdominal pain.  We think that this pain is 
either from irritation of your stomach or a very mild 
pancreatitis.  We treated you with pain medications which you 
did not think helped very much and bowel rest for a day.  We 
also did a CT scan of your abdomen which did not show anything 
concerning.

We also treated you for alcohol withdrawal while you were here 
and continued you on your methadone.  We also treated you for an 
asthma exacerbation and your breathing was much improved by the 
time you left.
 
Followup Instructions:
