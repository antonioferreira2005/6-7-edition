Brief Hospital Course:
___ with HTN, HLD, DM who felt right sided weakness and was 
transferred to ___ where ___ showed hyperdense sign.  NIHSS 
was 15. He was given tpa at 11:25am. Repeat NIHSS was 10. He was 
transferred to ___ for possible intervention.  On arrival to 
ED, NIHSS was 4.  Imaging showed clot in the left M1 with large 
area of mismatch on CT perfusion. There was significant 
discussion regarding the risk benefit of thrombectomy. However, 
as the patient was only 3 hours from his last known normal and 
there was a significant portion of cortex at risk. The decision 
was made to go for clot retrieval knowing that it was possible 
that the patient would worsen significantly without 
intervention. 
.
Neurologic: 
Pt was given tPA at ___ and underwent ___ clot retrieval 
for L MCA thrombus. 24 hr post tpa showed a small degree of 
hyperdensity in left frontal region consistent with evolving 
infarct vs hemorrhagic conversion. ASA and SQH were started 24 
hour after tPA. TSH 3.4. He was seen on MRI to have infarcts in 
L MCA distribution. He was transferred out of Neuro ICU to ___ 
and monitored on q2 neurochecks. Heis exam was seen to improve 
with only persisting nonfluent aphasia. He worked with ___ 
while inpatient. On ___, he underwent repeat NCHCT which was 
negative for new hemorrhage and patient was started on Eliquis 
for AC therapy. He was recommended for discharge home outpatient 
___. 
.
Cardiovascular: 
He was found to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR that did not 
respond to two doses of Lopressor. Diltiazem gtt was started and 
titrated up for rate control. Patient was maintained with SBP 
goal 100-180. Echocardiogram showed ___ dilation, no ASD, 
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = ___ %), 
right RV dilation with moderate mid to distal free wall 
hypokinesis. He was later started on Eliquis for AC therapy as 
noted above. He was switched to q6 Diltiazem titrated for 
appropriate HR control while inpatient. Pt had continued 
tachycardia with physical exertion with no relief from ___ rate 
control agent (Metoprolol). He was evaluated by Cardiology and 
underwent TEE with planned cardioversion on ___, although seen 
to have mobile thrombus in left atrial appendage. He was started 
on Digoxin with Diltiazem stopped. After discussion with 
Cardiology and pt's family, decided to continue with Eliquis for 
AC therapy >1 month prior to repeat TEE with cardioversion as 
well as outpatient event monitor. 

Endocrine:  
Found to have undiagnosed DM with A1C 7.1. He was maintained on 
Insulin sliding scale and diabetic diet.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of right sided weakness 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms. You received blood thinner medication 
to break up blockage in major blood vessel as well as vascular 
intervention to retrieve this clot.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
High blood pressure
High cholesterol
Diabetes

We are changing your medications as follows:
Please continue taking Eliquis 5mg twice daily
Please continue taking Atorvastatin 40mg every evening
Please continue taking Metoprolol XL 150mg daily
Please continue taking Digoxin 0.25 mcg daily
Please continue taking Lisinopril 2.5mg daily
Please take your other medications as prescribed. Upon 
discharge, please arrange to have a cardiac event monitor to 
monitor heart rate and atrial fibrillation. 

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician. 
Please follow up with Cardiology and consider seeing a 
cardiologist near your home (below is a list). With their 
assistance, you will be able to undergo a repeat ultrasound of 
the heart with cardioversion after sufficient time has passed on 
blood thinner medication. Please continue to work with physical 
therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy as outpatient 
(prescriptions provided). 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
