Conclusions  
PREBYPASS

1. The left atrium is normal in size. Left atrial appendage PWD 
velocities were > 20 cm/sec

2. No atrial septal defect or PFO is seen by 2D or color 
Doppler. 

3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. 
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%). 

4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. 

5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are 
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 

6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet excursion. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 

7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with a 
significant thickening along the tip of the anterior leaflet 
between A2 and A3. A small torn mitral chordae may be present in 
the right atria. Predominantly moderate or at worst 
Intermittently moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen with a >=0.7cm withan eccentric, posteriorly directed jet. 
Mitral valve area is 2.5 cm2, with a mitral annular diameter of 
3.4 cm. 

8. There is no pericardial effusion.

9. Dr. ___ of all results during the surgery.

POSTBYPASS
1. ___ is on phenlyephrine and low dose epinephrine

2. The left ventricular function remains similar to prebypass

3. The mitral valve had ___ stitch placed. Post bypass 
MVA measured 3.4 cm2 with a mitral annular diameter of 2.3 cm. 
The vena ___ was 0.7 cm. The MR jet is directed along the 
posterior wall.

4. The aortic wall is smooth after decannulation.

5. There is no left atrial appendage seen s/p ligation. 

6. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam. 
  
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance 
with ___ regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted ___ for heparin given her 
history of atrial fibrillation.  On ___ she underwent a 
coronary artery bypass graft, mitral valve replacement, and MAZE 
procedure with left atrial ligation.  This procedure was 
performed by Dr. ___.  The ___ tolerated the procedure 
well and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the 
surgical intensive care unit. She was extubated and weaned from 
her pressors by post-operative day two.  By post-operative day

floor.  Her chest tubes and wires were removed.  Coumadin was 
started for her atrial fibrillation history her INR ___ was 
2.4 after rec'ing coumadin 2mg x3days.  She was seen in 
consultation by the physical therapy service.  By post-operative 
day 5 she was ready for discharge to rehab.
