Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 97.3 P:70 BP:133/58 RR:17 O2 sat 
100%RA. EKG showed new Q in lead III. Troponin <0.01, CK 112. 
Creatinine was at baseline 1.4.  
.
# Chest Pain: Patient with risk factors for ACS including 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, vascular disease and known CAD. 
However, cardiac enzymes negative and EKG with a new q wave in 
III which is non-specific. However, chest pain as described is 
very atypical for cardiac chest pain in distribution and quality 
and it was relieved by bowel movement/eating and not relieved by 
SL nitrogen. This is most consistent with GI (patient recently 
swithched from protonix to omeprazole and may have missed a day 
or two and the pain was improved with bowel movement and 
eating), musculoskeletal pain (though not reprodouceable), 
anxiety (patient's dog died 10 days ago and she has been 
depressed and crying), vagal (given feeling of warmth and 
general weakness in the setting of stress and hunger). Her 
visual change is concerning for TIA, but there are no other 
neuro symptoms. Acute MI is less likely but needs to be ruled 
out given her history and risk factors.  She was observed 
overnight, 2 sets of enzymes came back negative and repeat EKG 
was unchanged.  She was monitored on telemetry, continued on 
___, BB, ACE, statin, had no more episodes of chest pain 
and was discharged the following day back on protonix. 
.  
# Hypertension:  Continued home dose of HCTZ, atenolol, 
lisinopril and nifedipine  
.  
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued statin  
.  
# Chronic Pain:  Continue home regimen of cyclobenzaprine prn, 
tylenol prn.  
.  
# Chronic Diarrhea:  Loperamide as needed.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital with chest tightness.  We did blood 
tests that did not show any evidence of heart damage or heart 
attack.  You were seen by your cardiologist who recommended 
outpatient stress test.  Your chest pain was improved with bowel 
movement and eating which makes us think the chest pain was 
related to your GI system and possibly worsened by the stress of 
your recent loss of your dog.
.
We made no changes in your medications.
.
Please follow up with your primary care doctor and with your 
cardiologist as below.  
.
If you have worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, 
confusion, slurred speech, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, 
chills or any other symptoms that are concerning to you please 
call your doctor or come to the emergency room.
