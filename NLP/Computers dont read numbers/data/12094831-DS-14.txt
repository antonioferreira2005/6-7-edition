Chief Complaint:

History of Present Illness:
___ male with a past medical history of hypertension,
chronic knee pain, osteoarthritis of the shoulder and knees
bilaterally, status post gastric bypass who presents to the
emergency department for evaluation of right shoulder pain. 

Patient reports frequent use shoulder in past 2 days,
specifically in the setting of mopping and cleaning and during
this time noted increased pain of the right shoulder. He denies
skin changes, numbness, paresthesias. No fevers or chills at
home.

Patient usually has decreased range of motion at the right
shoulder joint most pronounced with problems abduction past 90Â°,
extension of the shoulder joint as well as external rotation. In
the past, patient has had physical therapy for his right 
shoulder
and has had frozen shoulder before. Ultimately it was increased
pain that prompted presentation 

In the ED, initial VS were: T97.2 HR86 BP115/58 RR 20 94% RA

Exam notable for:
General: Well-appearing male in no acute distress.
Left upper extremity:
- The right shoulder is full to palpation relative to the left.
There is no overlying erythema, but there is modest warmth to 
the
touch. Exquisite pain is produced by short arc ROM and axial
loading. The arm cannot really be moved out of anatomical
position without causing severe pain. 
- Skin intact
- No deformity, edema, ecchymosis, erythema, induration
- Soft, non-tender arm and forearm
- Full, painless ROM at elbow, wrist, and digits
- Fires EPL/FPL/DIO
- SILT axillary/radial/median/ulnar nerve distributions
- 2+ radial pulse, WWP

ECG:

Labs:
-CBC: WBC 11.3, Hgb 13.3, Plt 227
-Chemistry: Na 134, K3.8, BUN 10, Sr Cr 0.8
-CRP 219

Imaging:
CXR ___: 
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. Glenohumeral
shoulder ___: No comparison. Four views of the right 
shoulder
are provided. No acute fracture. No dislocation. However, severe
degenerative changes at the level of the humeral glenoid joint
are seen, with extensive subcortical sclerosis, degenerative 
cyst
formation and osteophyte formation. The acromiohumeral distance
is normal. 

Consults:
Orthopedics: Worsening shoulder pain, pain with short arc/axial
load, and wbc 12/crp 220. Unable to aspirate sufficient joint
fluid for testing. ___ cannot aspirate until ___. Would 
therefore
recommend:
 - Obs overnight for ___ arthrocentesis in AM
 - Please send ___ fluid for cell count, gram stain and culture
 - NPO MN; if fluid positive, potential for OR

Transfer VS were: T 99.4  HR 69  BP 105/65  RR 16  SpO2 96% RA

On arrival to the floor, patient reports that his shoulder
continues to cause him significant pain. He is unable to move 
his
shoulder without pain, and has been holding it close to his 
body.
He takes up to 8 Percocets daily for chronic polyarticular
osteoarthritis, therefore he asks that he be able to receive
additional meds for pain relief.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with HTN, with adhesive capsulitis of right shoulder, 
bilateral knee OA s/p bilateral TKR, s/p gastric bypass admitted 
with acute on chronic right shoulder pain, initially concerning 
for possible septic arthritis in the setting of an elevated CRP 
>200. 

ACUTE ISSUES ADDRESSED:
=======================
# Right shoulder pain, concern for septic arthritis
# Chonic adhesive capsulitis
# Biceps tendonitis
Presenting with acute on chronic right shoulder pain. CRP > 200 
on admission. Underwent ___ aspiration ___, and was started on 
IV vancomycin/ceftriaxone while awaiting final results of fluid 
cultures. Fluid studies were notable for ___ WBCs, 88% PMNs, 
no crystals. Gram stain unremarkable, and joint fluid cultures 
with no growth to date. His symptoms have now improved and joint 
cultures have remained negative. Given cell counts and negative 
cultures thus far, more likely that this represents acute flare 
of inflammatory arthritis rather than septic arthritis. 
Additionally, he has had no fever, with only mild leukocytosis 
to 11.5 which may have been reactive. No acute intervention per 
orthopedics. Antibiotics were discontinued and he will follow up 
in ___ clinic as an outpatient. We will continue to 
follow up joint fluid cultures over the next few days until 
finalized. He was given PRN oxycodone (he's on Percocet for pain 
chronically, at home), and he will resume this on discharge. 
However, we have recommended Tylenol and NSAIDs PRN (max daily 
Tylenol dose, including what's contained in Percocet, 4gm/day), 
lidocaine patch, and home physical therapy to decrease opiate 
requirements.

# Hyponatremia: Mild, asymptomatic, potentially in the setting 
of pain.  Low urine sodium, elevated UOsm was consistent with 
hypovolemia. Hyponatremia resolved after IV administration. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Hypertension: 
Home HCTZ and Losartan were held on admission in anticipation of 
potential need for OR washout. These were resumed on discharge.

#Osteoarthritis
Continue home Percocet for pain PRN.

#Preventative care:
Continue home ASA daily.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Antibiotics were discontinued and he will follow up in 
___ clinic as an outpatient
[] Follow up joint fluid cultures over the next few days until 
finalized
[] Further workup for inflammatory arthritis (CCP, RF, hand 
x-rays, etc.) per rheumatology at outpatient follow up
[] Pain control with tylenol, NSAIDS OTC as needed, lidocaine 
patch
[] Physical therapy to eval and treat at home for R shoulder 
pain

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

Why was I admitted to the hospital?  
- You were admitted with acute on chronic right shoulder pain 
with increased immobility.

What happened while I was in the hospital?  
- Blood work showed elevated inflammatory markers, but you had 
no fever. Due to concern for infected joint, you underwent fluid 
aspiration and were placed on IV antibiotics. 
- Fluid evaluation has not shown evidence of infection to date 
and your symptoms improved. 
- You were seen by orthopedics and rheumatology services. Fluid 
cultures from your joint have not grown any bacteria. It is 
unlikely at this point that your joint is infected. Your 
antibiotics were subsequently discontinued and the fluid 
cultures will be monitored for the next several days.  
- You are discharged to home with recommendation to pursue 
outpatient physical therapy.

What should I do after leaving the hospital?  
-  Please take your medications as listed in discharge summary 
and follow up at the listed appointments. 

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!  

Sincerely,

Your ___ Healthcare Team
