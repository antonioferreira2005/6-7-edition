improvement in Cr. Lisinopril and Vanc held on ___. He was found 
to have elevated PVR of 480 and was started on tamsulosin 
without much effect and he continued to need catheterizations. A 
foley was placed and his creatinine stabilized with continued 
fluids. He remained stable for several days, though his 
creatinine rose to 2.5 when fluids were discontinued on the 
night of ___. He was again started on 200mL/hr ___ and his 
creatinine stabilized at 2.4 and was downtrending at 2.3 on 
discharge after 14 hours of only oral fluids. Likely 
multifactorial with initial insult likely obstructive 
nephropathy versus vancomycin toxicity followed by improvement 
after Foley placement. ___ worsened again after large 
post-obstructive diuresis and prerenal injury which improved 
with IVF and oral fluids. He was discharged with his foley and 
plans for close urology/PCP follow up.

#DM II well controlled
In the hospital he was switched to an insulin sliding scale from 
his home oral regiment of glipizide and metformin. He needed

[] Mr. ___ developed ___ in the hospital which was 
resolving, his electrolytes and creatinine will need to be 
monitored until he reaches his baseline creatinine (1.0). Cr on 
discharge was 2.3.
[] He has been discharged with a foley catheter because of acute 
urinary retention secondary to obstruction. This will need to be 
discontinued with urology and he may need additional treatment

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. You were admitted 
to the Podiatric Surgery service for treatment of your left foot 
infection. You were taken to the OR twice during your 
hospitalization for treatment of the infection. You were given 
IV antibiotics while here and transitioned to oral medications.

You developed a kidney injury likely caused by an obstruction to 
urinary flow that was relieved by placing a foley catheter. You 
received IV fluids and your kidney function has improved. You 
should continue to use a foley catheter until you are able to 
follow up with your urologist on ___. Please continue to 
drink plenty of water as your urine output is still elevated.

You are being discharged home with the following instructions: 

ACTIVITY:
There are restrictions on activity. Please remain weight bearing 
to the heel on your L foot with a surgical shoe until your 
follow up appointment. You should keep this site elevated when 
ever possible (above the level of the heart!) 

No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.
PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:
Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s).
New pain, numbness or discoloration of your foot or toes.
Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever
