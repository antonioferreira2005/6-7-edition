Ferritn-8.0* TRF-___ with PMHx of uterine fibroids (s/p fibroidectomy) and 
chronic iron deficiency  anemia attributed to heavy menses who 
presented with symptomatic anemia and was found to have BRBPR on 
rectal exam.  GI was consulted and pt underwent both upper and 
lower endoscopy that were essentially unrevealing for a source 
of acute bleeding.  There were non-bleeding gr 1 internal 
hemorrhoids seen that may have contributed to the BRBPR on 
admisison.  Pt was having menses on admission and hct continued 
to drift down after transfusion with 2u prbcs.  She was given a 
third transfusion after which she felt symptomatically improved 
with no DOE or LH.  Pt reported difficulty tolerating oral iron 
and she was given IV ferric gluconate while in house due to her 
severe iron deficiency anemia.  Gyn was consulted and pt 
underwent a pelvic ultrasound.  Prelim read showed stable 
fibroids and her primary gynecologist Dr. ___ was notified.  
Pt was scheduled to follow up early next week with her primary 
gynecologist to review further management of her menorrhagia and 
to review the final u/s report.  Pt was given a prescription for 
colace to help with iron related constipation and evncouraged to 
continue taking iron twice daily. 
.
She was continued on her home regimen for hypertension and is 
scheduled to be seen at HCA in 2weeks.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with symptomatic anemia and you have been 
treated with blood transfusions and IV iron replacement.  You 
were seen by gastroenterology for both EGD and colonoscopy which 
was unrevealing for a source of bleeding.  We think that your 
symptomatic anemia was most likely related to your heavy menses 
and fibroids.   You were seen by the gynecology team and had a 
pelvic ultrasound which showed stable fibroids.
.
We made the following changes to your medication regimen:
1. You need to continue taking oral iron every day 
2. Start taking colace 100mg BID
.
Otherwise, you should continue taking all your other medications 
as you were prior to admission.
.
