Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. s/p L SFA stent in ___ by Dr. ___ -- we were able to 
obtain faint DP signals ___ s/p L THR and early morning POD2, 
however later in the day POD2 we were unable to obtain DP 
doppler signal. Vascular surgery was consulted and, during their 
evaluation in the evening POD2, DP signals were not appreciated. 
The patient was started on a heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80, 
lovenox was dc'd. On POD3 we were again able to get a faint DP 
doppler signal. Noninvasive vascular studies were performed 
which showed his L SFA stent was occluded, however this was 
likely an event that happened pre-operatively given he has no 
ischemic signs or symptoms and no ischemic pain. Hep gtt was 
dc'd, lovenox was resumed. He will follow-up with Dr. ___ as 
an outpatient.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by 
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient 
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of 
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was 
voiding independently thereafter. The overlying dressing was 
removed on POD#2 and the Silverlon dressing was found to be 
clean and dry. The patient was seen daily by physical therapy. 
Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and repleted 
accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating 
a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was afebrile with 
stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and 
pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen. The operative 
extremity was neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with posterior precautions. 
Walker or two crutches at all times for 6 weeks.  He was cleared 
for discharge to rehab by physical therapy.
 
Mr. ___ is discharged to rehab in stable condition.
