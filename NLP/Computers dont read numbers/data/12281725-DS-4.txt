Findings  
This study was compared to the prior study of ___.  
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild ___. 
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. 
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. 
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting 
LVOT gradient. 
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. 
AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root. Normal ascending aorta 
diameter. 
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AS. 
Mild (1+) AR. 
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MR. 
___ VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild 
[1+] TR. Normal PA systolic pressure. 
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen. 
PERICARDIUM: Very small pericardial effusion. No 
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 
CONCLUSIONS: 
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly 
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets are mildly 
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is a very small pericardial 
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Very small pericardial 
effusion adjacent to lateral wall. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved biventricular cavity size 
and global/regional systolic function. Mild aortic 
regurgitation. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
regional wall motion abnormalities are not appreciated. Aortic 
regurgitation is present. The effusion is new.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was a same day admit and on ___ was brought directly 
to the operating room where he underwent a coronary artery 
bypass graft x 4. Please see operative note for surgical 
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for 
invasive monitoring in stable condition. He had post-operative 
bleeding with a drop in hematocrit to 28.5 when 2 units of blood 
were transfused. He remained stable hemodynamically and 
postoperative bleeding resolved. Later this day he was weaned 
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On 
post-op day one he was started on beta-blockers and diuretics 
and gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. Later this day he 
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. Chest 
tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. He 
was started on Imdur for his radial artery harvest which will 
continue for 3 months. His creatinue peaked at 2.0 mild ___ 
currently trending down. His WBC were also elevate but are 
trending down. Cultures negative. He remains afebrile and his 
wounds are healing well. Physical therapy worked with patient 
post-op for assistance with strength and mobility. He was 
discharged home with services on POD 4 with appropriate 
follow-up instructions.
