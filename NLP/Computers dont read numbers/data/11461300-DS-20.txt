History of Present Illness:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ y/o F with a PMH of ILD, PE on warfarin, 
and elevated ___, presenting with worsening DOE and ___ edema 
over the past 3 weeks. The patient originally presented for hip 
pain to ___. She was found to have respiratory distress 
which she noted has been worsening over the last few weeks. 
During a recent visit to her PCP ___ ___ the patient was noted 
to have mild tachypnea despite her weight being "under her 
baseline" at 218Lbs. She was switched from torsemide 80mg to 
Bumex 2mg for her fluid overload ___ to presumed pulmonary 
hypertension. When she arrived at outside hospital they 
initially gave 500 cc of fluid, asa 325mg and heparin given 
elevated troponin and tachypnea for presumed NSTEMI. The patient 
had an xray and was transferred to ___ for management 
of a presumed CHF exaccerbation. Prior to leaving ___ it 
was reported that the patient diuresed approximately 1500cc 
wihtout active diuresis.  
 
On arrival to the ED in ___ the patient continued to complain 
of chronic hip pain and remained dyspnic. Patient's initial 
vitals were 97.9 105 109/70 26 96% bipap. Patient noted to have 
increased intersitial edema noted on CXR and prominent pulmonary 
vasculature markings. She was given 40mg of IV Lasix x2 in the 
ED. The patient also had a full set of labs showing a trop of 
0.21, WBC of 11.7, INR of 1.5 (patient holding warfarin for 
procedure for hip pain) and proBNP of 4442. Her lactate notably 
decreased from 4 to 1.7 after transfer from the OSH. Given 
continued respiratory distress and signs of fluid overload the 
patient was evaluated by the at___ cardiology and cardiology 
fellow for admission to the CCU. 

On arrival to the CCU, the patient reports shortness of breath 
and pain in her hip. The patient also reported being tired since 
she has been unable to get any sleep throughout the night.

PERTINENT RESULTS:
==================

TTE ___:
Conclusions  
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is 
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The estimated cardiac index is normal 
(>=2.5L/min/m2). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent 
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal chamber size and 
hyperdynamic systolic function. Right ventricle not well see but 
systolic function appears normal. Mild aortic regurgitation. 
Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary 
hypertension. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ the 
apical windows on the current study are poor. There is slightly 
more aortic regurgitation. Pulmonary artery pressures are lower 
(but there were limited windows for interrogation so the current 
study could have underestimated). Other findings are not 
significantly changed.   

CXR ___:
Mild pulmonary edema superimposed on background interstitial 
lung disease.

CTA ___: 
Pulmonary embolism in all 3 main lobar branches of the right 
pulmonary artery as well as the main lobar branches supplying 
the lingula and left upper lobe. 

MRI Brain (___):
1. No acute infarction or hemorrhage. 
2. No significant abnormalities on MRA of the head although 
slightly limited 
by motion. 

CT head (___):
Mild brain atrophy and small vessel disease are identified.  No 
hemorrhage 
mass effect midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.  A tiny chronic 
right 
cerebellar infarct noted.  Bone images are unremarkable.  
Visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ has a history CHF, PE, ILD presenting with CHF 
exacerbation after having her home torsemide dose decreased to 
40 mg. She was treated with a Lasix gtt and improved 
symptomatically. She had a CTA chest that showed new b/l PEs in 
the setting of holding her warfarin for an SI injection. She 
also had episodes of decreased responsiveness and alertness that 
were initially concerning for stroke. However, a stroke work-up 
and Neurology evaluation revealed no evidence of stroke or 
stroke deficits.

ACUTE ISSUES:

#) ACUTE DECOMPENSATED DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: 
LVEF >75%% ___ to ILD and Pulmonary Hypertension. Pt with 
subacute progression of dyspnea ___ heart failure with 
underlying ILD and pulmonary HTN. Elevated troponin likely 
secondary to heart strain from fluid overload. Has now returned 
to her baseline oxygen requirement of 2 L, remains mildly 
hypervolemic on examination, and responding appropriately to 
diuresis with lasix IV, then transitioned to home torsemide 80 
mg BID.

# PE: 
Pt with hx of PE. Upon thorough assessment of recent coumadin 
dosing, she has been subtherapeutic in ___ for a period 
of time during which she was preparing for a procedure. CTA 
showed PE in all 3 main lobar branches of the right pulmonary 
artery as well as the main lobar branches supplying the lingula 
and left upper lobe.  Patient was on heparin IV gtt, re-dosing 
warfarin daily for therapeutic INR. On discharge continuing on 
warfarin at 5 mg on ___, with INR of 2.2.

# Episode of drowsiness/non-responsiveness:
Resolved: Patient had episode of sudden onset drowsiness and 
decreased responsiveness concerning for stroke, with CT head and 
MRI/MRA brain revealing no abnormalities or acute process. At 
baseline she has left facial droop. ABG showed pH 7.48 and 
lactate 2.2, with pCO2 39, which indicates that she is not 
hypercarbic. She currently has no anion gap. It is less likely 
due to hepatic encephalopathy, given normal AST/ALT, and also 
less likely infection since she has been afebrile and her 
leukocytosis is likely due to chronic steroids. Neurology was 
consulted, did EEG, and it showed no epileptiform activity. On 
___ had second episode of lethargy, similar to first. 
Lactate 3.2, no neuro deficits. Touched base w/Neurology on 
___: based on their exam on ___ and the negative results of 
CT head and MRI head, they don't recommend further work-up; the 
EEG from ___ shows no epileptiform activity. ABG (___) pH 
7.38 pCO2 59  pO2 47  HCO3 36, lactate 2.5. UA large 
leukesterase and WBC 43 on ___. Per Neurology consult, motor 
deficits of LUE are consistent with cervical myelopathy, and the 
etiology of her symptoms could be multifold with general 
deconditioning from a prolonged hospital course and increased 
work of breathing prior to admission, in addition to her 
baseline connective tissue disease. Per Neurology recs, consider 
C-spine and lumbar-spine MRI as outpatient after rehab to 
evaluate cervical myelopathy and RLE deficits.

CHRONIC ISSUES:    

# Rheumatalogic disease: 
The patient has an unclear history of rheumatologic disease, 
with positive ANAs in the past. During prior admission ___, Ro 
and Sm antibodies were positive. She was diagnosed with 
undifferentiated connective tissue disease (CTD). Patient was on 
steroids as outpatient for concurrent treatment with her ILD. 
Continued home prednisone 20mg, atovaquone suspension.

# ILD  
Patient's underlying cause of the ILD is unknown. Her last echo 
showed an estimated PAPs of 33 giving evidence of PHTN. The 
patient has had relatively stable symptoms over the past few 
years; however, her chest xray on admission is worse, possibly 
___ to overlying edema on ILD. Continued prednisone as above, 
inhalers.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

- anticoagulation: pt was found to have b/l PEs on CTA chest 
after having Coumadin briefly held in preparation for SI 
injection. She should NOT stop warfarin even for procedures. Her 
regimen is warfarin 5 mg daily.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted for increased fluid retention after your home 
dose of Torsemide was changed. You were treated with IV 
diuretics and improved greatly. You were also found to have new 
blood clots in your lungs, although they didn't injure your lung 
tissue. This means that you should NEVER stop taking warfarin, 
even before procedures. Please follow up with your doctors as 
___ below. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you the best! 

Sincerely,
Your ___ cardiology team
