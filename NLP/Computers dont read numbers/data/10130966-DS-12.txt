Micro:
All Blood, sputum and urine cultures negative

___ Ba swallow :
No evidence of leak.

___ Ba swallow :
No evidence of leak allowing for limitations of the exam.

___ CXR :
In comparison with the study of ___, there is little 
overall change. 
Continued postsurgical changes at the right base with left 
basilar 
opacification consistent with pleural fluid and underlying 
atelectasis. No evidence of pneumothorax. 

___ Cardiac echo :
Biatrial enlargement. Normal left ventricular wall thickness, 
chamber size and global systolic function. Mild regional 
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (Diagonal or Obtuse marginal). Mild 
mitral regurgitation. Mildly dilated aortic sinus.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the hospital and taken to the 
Operating Room where he underwent a minimally invasive ___ 
___ esophagectomy, laparoscopic jejunostomy tube placement, 
and pleural flap buttress to esophagogastric anastomosis. He 
tolerated the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable 
condition.  He was fluid resuscitated over the next ___ hours and 
had stable hemodynamics. J tube feedings were started via his J 
tube on post op day #1 tolerated well.  They were gradually 
advanced daily to reach his goal.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor on ___ he 
developed a temperature of 102 and was pan cultured.  His chest 
xray showed bibasilar atelectesis and he also had a barium 
swallow done which ruled out an esophageal leak.  His chest tube 
was removed but he maintained NPO status and his temperature was 
up and down over the next day.  He was using his incentive 
spirometer effectively and was deep breathing and coughing well. 
His WBC peaked to 13K.  He remained off antibiotics and his 
wounds were healing well.

Around the same time as his temperature spike he also developed 
rapid atrial fibrillation to 150 associated with concurrent 
hypotension with SBP in the high ___, though mentating and no 
acute distress.  He was given a total of IV metoprolol 20mg 
without change in HR and then given amiodarone 150mg IV bolus 
x1. He denied chest pain, palpitations and dyspnea.  He reported 
having no history of afib and not been on anticoagulation 
previously. He was transferred back to the SICU for treatment of 
his atrial fibrillation on an Amiodarone drip as well as IV 
Diltiazem. He eventually converted to NRS in the ___.  His 
Amiodarone was stopped on ___ and his Diltiazem was 
converted to oral. He had a troponin bump to a high of 3.04 
during his RAF but the cardiology service thought it was from 
demand ischemia.  His TTE revealed a normal LV with mild 
anterior hypokinesis.  Anticoagulation was recommended as wellas 
a Persantine stress test  as an out patient.  he was started on 
Rivaroxiban on ___ and hopefully will be on it for a short 
time as he continues to maintain NSR.

He was transferred back to the Surgical floor on ___ and 
continued to progress well.  A second barium swallow on ___ 
revealed no leak and he began a liquid diet along with oral 
madications which he tolerated well.  His J tube feedings 
continued with Osmolyte 1.5 cycled at 80 cc's/hr over 18 hrs.  
His JP drain was removed following the barium swallow and his 
other wounds were healing well.  Both he and his wife were 
instructed in the care and use of the J tube and ___ will also 
be involved once he gets home for more teaching and 
reinforcement. He was using his incentive spirometer effectively 
and his room air saturations were 94% with activity.  He did 
have some difficulty expectorating his secretions and 
guaifenacin was prescribed.

On ___ he was discharged home with ___ services and will 
follow up with Dr. ___ Cardiology in a few weeks.
