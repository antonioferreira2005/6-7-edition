RISK ASSESSMENT:
This patient is not suicidal/homicidal, is feeling well and is 
animated, euthymic, and participatory in the milieu, all of 
which indicate a low immediate risk of harm.
Static risk factors include:
-chronic and severe mental illness,
Modifiable risk factors include:
- active polysubstance misuse, acute major mood episode. We 
modified this risk by uptitrating the patient's celexa and 
Seroquel. 
Protective factors include:
-Protective factors include current outpatient 
providers/treatment, skills in problem solving, conflict 
resolution and handling problems in a non-violent way. Current 
risk is low for intentional self-harm given that pt denies 
suicidal ideation, intent and plan, is accepting of treatment, 
is currently sober and is future oriented with plans to obtain 
housing and continue with treatment. 

INFORMED CONSENT
I discussed the indications for, intended benefits of, and 
possible side effects and risks of this medication, and risks 
and benefits of possible alternatives, including not taking the 
medication, with this patient.  We discussed the patient's right 
to decide whether to take this medication as well as the 
importance of the patient's actively participating in the 
treatment and discussing any questions about medications with 
the treatment team, and I answered the patient's questions.  The 
patient appeared able to understand and consented to begin the 
medication.

motivated to  get treatment.
