Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: ___ year old woman with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG and PCI
here with unstable angina.

Plan: 
#unstable angina/CAD: 
Troponins negative and EKG w/o change, however chest
pressure persists. Initially thought angina but coronary 
angiogram did not show any significant change from prior, with 
LIMA and 2 SVGs patent. Patient feels that this may be more 
severe GERD and she was encouraged to take ranitidine 75 mg at 
night in addition to her omeprazole and sulcrafate. Increase 
activity decrease calorie consumption as outpt to
promote weight loss. Recommended cardiac rehab.

#GERD: states that UA coincided with worsening GERD which she
experiences as throat burning. She has undergone several
gastrointestinal studies including esophageal manometry which
demonstrated a 4 cm hiatal hernia. She had an pH esophageal
study which showed appropriate acid suppression.
-MOM and TUMs PRN

150 mg at night.
