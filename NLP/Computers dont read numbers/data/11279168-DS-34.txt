Imaging:

Lower extremity Doppler
  
1.  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower 
extremity veins. 
  
2.  Subcutaneous edema. 

CT C-Spine ___ ___
     
     FINDINGS:  Degenerative changes cervical spine are 
advanced.  There
     is stable minimal anterolisthesis C4 on C5, C7 on T1, 
likely
     degenerative.  Alignment is otherwise stable.  No fractures 
are
     identified.Multilevel degenerative changes, disc osteophyte
     complexes,, posterior element hypertrophic changes.  There 
is
     multilevel mild-to-moderate central canal narrowing, most 
prominent
     at C4-C5, C6-C7 levels.  C5-C6 vertebral bodies are fused.  
There is
     multilevel moderate to severe foraminal narrowing.  There 
is no
     prevertebral soft tissue swelling. There is no evidence of 
infection
     or neoplasm.  Small focus of low attenuation involving C7 
vertebral
     body is residua of prior Schmorl's node.
      
      
     IMPRESSION:  No acute fracture.

CT Head ___ ___

  IMPRESSION:  Subacute on chronic left hemispheric subdural 
hematoma,
     no new hemorrhage since prior.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M with PMhx of CAD s/p CABG in ___, NSTEMI, systolic
CHF (EF 35-40%), PVD s/p bypass, CKD stage III, 
history of LLE DVT s/p IVC filter, chronic SDH, dementia and
frequent falls transferred from ___ after a fall with
subacute on chronic SDH and UTI. 

#Subacute on chronic SDH Patient presented with fall. Per 
neurosurgery who reviewed the CT head: CT head stable with left 
subacute on chronic SDH, no new hemorrhage,
no midline shift. They did not feel that he had an indication 
for surgery. The neurosurgery team recommended follow up in 
clinic with repeat head CT in ___ weeks with Dr. ___ 
(___). His aspirin is being held until he follows up 
with neurosurgery. 

#UTI
#Urinary Retention
Patient with admission in ___ for UTI, and was on CTX 
until
___ for parapneumonic effusion. He had urinary retention and 
had
catheter in place on admission. UTI may be catheter
associated though may have had urinary frequency. Given fall and 
?change in mental status causing fall decision was made to treat 
his UTI with Ceftriaxone. Unfortunately, micro data from ___ 
___ grew Proteus with ESBL profile, sensitive to Zosyn, 
Ceftazadime, and Ertapenem, so decision was made to switch to 
Ertapenem 1 g daily IM (IV access unavailable because patient 
continues to rip out IV's) for total of ___ days (___). His Foley was discontinued on admission but in the 
setting of likely catheter-associated UTI it was discontinued on 
admission. He failed multiple voiding trials and a new Foley was 
replaced on ___ prior to discharge. We also continued his 
home Finasteride and tamsulosin 

#Fall
He ___ had multiple falls recently with most recent fall 
witnessed. Unclear if fall was syncope related or not per 
history. ___ be vasovagal in setting of bathroom use. Other ddx 
includes orthostasis and cardiogenic causes though very low
likelihood. Will discharge back to his long term rehab facility. 


#Toxic metabolic encephalopathy
#Dementia/delirium
Patient uncooperative and agitated requiring Haldol at ___.
Per grandchildren, he is known to sundown and ___ difficulty
adjusting to new environments. His agitation was an issue during
last admission and psych was consulted who recommended 2.5mg
Haldol BID. He ___ not required this back at his SNF. His 
current
encephalopathy is likely delirium related provoked by his UTI.
Required 1 dose of IV Haldol overnight ___ but stable without 
any issues on ___. He required no other antipsychotics for 
agitation. We suspect he will return to baseline after treatment 
for UTI. AOx3 on discharge.

#LLL opacity
Likely related to his previous parapnemonic effusion. There was 
no
indication to intervene on this radiographic finding as patient
was afebrile without dyspnea, cough, and leukocytosis and 
imaging
findings can lag clinical resolution.
