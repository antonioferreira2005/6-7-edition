STUDIES:
========
RENAL U.S.  ___ 
IMPRESSION: Limited study with inability to visualize either 
kidney. If necessary, noncontrast CT may be performed.

EKG ___
Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave 
changes. 
The ST-T wave changes are more prominent in leads I and aVL as 
compared with prior tracing of ___ with the finding of 
biphasic T waves in 
leads I, aVL and V6. Followup and clinical correlation are 
suggested. 

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  ___ 
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The heart is top normal in size. The 
pulmonary vasculature is normal. The lungs are clear without 
focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. The 
osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o. M with HTN, CKD admitted with hypertensive emergency and 
acute on chronic renal failure. 

# Hypertension: SBP was in the 220s on admission. With patient's 
blood pressure not being well controlled on the floor, he was 
transferred to the MICU for better BP control with labetalol gtt 
and hydralazine IV prn. He was transferred back to the floor 
with SBP from 130s to 170s on labetalol 400 mg PO tid.  His 
labetalol was increased to 600 mg TID on the medicine floor, and 
his SBPs ranged from 130-150.  He was discharged with this 
increased dosage.
  
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal followed the patient 
while he was hospitalized.  Ultrafiltration was initiated in the 
MICU, and a tunnelled HD line was placed. Patient was still 
making urine. There was no hyperkalemia, encephalopathy, 
bleeding, or pericarditis.  He received hemodialysis 3 times a 
week while in the hospital.  Prior to discharge, he was set up 
with outpatient hemodialysis.  He was unable to get venous 
mapping prior to discharge, and he will need this as an 
outpatient.

# Anemia and thrombocytopenia: Hct was in the low ___ during the 
hospital stay. Hematology was consulted in the setting of 
concern for hemolysis with elevated LDH and decreased 
haptoglobin. No concern for TTP.  It was proposed that the 
anemia might be due to multiple factors including chronic kidney 
disease and possible hemolysis from shear force from malignant 
hypertension. His Hct remained stable during hospitalization.  
An ADAMST13 will need to be followed up as an outpatient.

# UTI: With ___ gram positive alpha hemolytic colonies on 
UCx.  Pt was started on ciprofloxacin to complete a 7 day course 
with instructions to hold ciprofloxacin on HD days until HD is 
completed.  
  
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued Statin.

# FEN: Cardiac diet. Repleted lytes prn.  

# PPx: heparin SC  
  
# Dispo: Home with outpatient hemodialysis.
