General: NAD
HEENT: MMM, no scleral icterus, tongue and trachea midline, no 
palpable lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruits
Cardiac: RRR
Pulmonary: CTAB
Abdomen: Soft, NT/ND
Extremities: Incision clean, dry, intact, no erythema or 
purulence. Pulse exam: R/L: p/p/p/p
 
Pertinent Results:
CTA ___
INDICATION:  ___ male with aortic occlusion status post 
aortobifem 
bypass, now with increasing FiO2 requirement and tachycardia, 
rule out 
pulmonary embolus. 
  
COMPARISON:  CTA abdomen and pelvis from ___. 
  
TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images of the chest were obtained following the 
uneventful 
administration of IV Omnipaque contrast.  Sagittal and coronal 
reformations 
were obtained.  Additionally, 3D reconstructed MIP images were 
obtained. 
  
FINDINGS: 
There is no pulmonary embolus.  Atherosclerotic calcifications 
are noted in 
the aorta and coronary arteries.  No thrombus is identified 
within the aorta.  
There is no pericardial effusion.   
  
There is a small left nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion and 
bibasilar 
atelectasis.  Additionally, there is extensive ground-glass and 
patchy opacity 
involving the bilateral upper lobes and the left lower lobe, 
which is new from 
the ___ chest radiograph. There is no pneumothorax.  
  
Mild degenerative changes are noted in the spine.  No suspicious 
lytic or 
blastic lesion is identified.   
  
Small foci of intraperitoneal free air are noted in the upper 
abdomen, likely 
related to the patient's recent aortobifemoral bypass surgery.  
The visualized 
structures in the upper abdomen are otherwise unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No pulmonary embolus. 
  
2.  Extensive ground-glass and patchy opacity involving 
predominantly the 
upper lobes.  Differential considerations include aspiration, 
pneumonia, and 
pulmonary edema. 
  
3.  Small left nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion with bibasilar 
atelectasis. 

Echocardiography ___
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic 
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical 
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular 
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic 
function. No defininte structural heart disease or pathologic 
flow identified.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service at the 
___ on ___ for evaluation and treatment. The patient 
underwent aortobifemoral bypass, end-to-end anastomosis with 14 
x 7-mm Dacron graft pm ___, which went well without 
complication. He was transfered to the CVICU where he continued 
to be monitored closely. He was diuresed and had good pain 
control with a pca. In the evening of ___ he was transfered to 
the VICU. On ___ he had respiratory distress, and was 
transfered back to the ___ where he was placed on bipap and 
diuresed. A ct was done which ruled out pulmonary embolus. It 
was felt that he had a chf exacerbation, respiratory status 
improved over the next ___ and he was transfered back to the 
VICU. He continued to be diuresed until ___ when he was felt to 
be back to baseline. He was deemed stable for discharge home. He 
worked with ___ and ambulated with a walker. He will be d/c'd 
with ___ and follow up in 2 weeks with ___ will follow up 
with his PCP for further evaluation of his chf, and discussion 
of diuresis.
