Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo woman with CAD, chronic diastolic CHF, and restrictive 
pulmonary disease presenting with worsened dyspnea on exertion 
and cough.

1) Reactive Airway Disease: The patient initially presented with 
worsening respiratory symptoms and mild hypoxia in the context 
of a presumed upper respiratory tract infection and significant 
wheezing and diminished air movement.  She carries no diagnosis 
of asthma or COPD and previous PFT's have shown primarily a 
restrictive defect, but she has a history of significant 
second-hand smoke exposure in her children and late husband.  
Despite reporting minimal improvement to a single albuterol 
nebulizer in the emergency department when placed on standing 
ipratroprium and albuterol nebulizers (then inhalers) her 
symptoms began to improve.  Lung sound improved on exam and 
wheezes diminished.  On her second hospital day (after a second 
chest radiograph failed to show an infiltrate) she was started a 
burst of forty milligrams of prednisone daily to be continued 
for five days.  She was also started on a five day course of 
azithromycin for possible bronchitis/element of COPD 
exacerbation given increased sputum.  At the time of discharge 
her chest tightness and dyspnea had improved and she was satting 
96% on room air.  

2) Viral Syndrome: The patient presented with congestion, 
headache, and generalized fatigue all consistent with a viral 
URI.  Though she was not having impressive fevers and remained 
afebrile in the hospital she did receive one dose of oseltamavir 
empirically in the ED before influenza was ruled out by an 
adequate DFA specimen.  After influenza was excluded she was 
managed symptomatically with benzonatate cough suppressants to 
suppress cough.  

3) Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient appeared 
euvolemic throughout her hospitalization.  She was continued on 
her home ASA, furosemide, lisinopril, and metoprolol.  

4) Coronary Artery Disease: The patient had no concerning ECG 
changes and her symptoms always were far more suggestive a 
respiratory etiology of her symptoms.  She was continued on her 
home aspirin, statin, and beta blocker in the hospital. 

5) Type II Diabetes melitus: The patient was continued on her 
home mix insulin at reduced doses given poor PO intake in the 
hospital and covered with insulin sliding scale with reasonable 
control of her blood pressures.  

6) Anemia: She was noted to become progressively more anemic 
throughout her hospitalization though the fall was minor. Stool 
was guaiac negative (performed once); this warrants further 
outpatient workup.

7) Sleep: The patient has insomnia at baseline for which she 
uses acetaminophen with diphenhydramine.  This was held in the 
hospital given the high risks associated antihistamines 
triggering delirium in the elderly. 

8) Hypertension: Her amlodipine was held given very well 
controlled blood pressures (but lisinopril, isosorbide, Lasix, 
metoprolol were continued). Amlodipine should be re-added if 
needed as an outpatient. 

The patient was continued on her home lisinopril, and metoprolol 
for hypertension with good control.  Her calcium and vitamin D 
for osteoporosis were similarly continued as was her omeprazole 
for GERD.  She continued to receive oxycodone-APAP for her back 
pain issues as she uses this at home.  She tolerated a 
full/diabetic diet prior to discharge.  She received SC heparin 
for DVT prophylaxis.  She was DNR with an understanding she 
would accept brief intubations for reversible causes.

Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnosis:
Reactive Airway Disease Exacerbation (Bronchitis vs COPD 
exacerbation)
Chronic Restrictive Lung Disease
Viral Upper Respiratory Tract Infection

Secondary Diagnoses:
Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure
Diabetes
Coronary Artery Disease

 
Discharge Condition:
Good, Satting 96% on RA with ambulation, less short of breath

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted because you were feeling unwell and had more 
shortness of breath.  We think this is likely because you had a 
cold that caused hyperactivity and constriction of your airways. 
 We treated you with antibiotics, bronchodilators, and started 
you on a course of steroids and your symptoms improved.  

Your medications have been changed.  You have been started on 
AZITHROMYCIN, an antibiotic to help treat any element of 
bacterial infection that may be worsening your shortness of 
breath.  You will need to continue this medication for two more 
days after you are discharged.  You were also started on 
ALBUTEROL and IPRATROPRIUM, two inhalers to help keep your 
airways open and make you less short of breath.  You should use 
these on a schedule for the next week and then can use them as 
needed for shortness of breath or wheezing afterward.  Finally, 
you were started on a short course of PREDNISONE, a steroid to 
help cut down on inflammation in your lungs and help your 
breathing.  You will complete two more days of this medication 
after discharge.  Finally, we discharged you with a prescription 
for TESSALON PERLES (BENZONATATE) for cough.  You may also be 
helped by MUCINEX or MUCINEX-DM two over the counter cough 
suppressants that you may find less nauseating than cough syrup. 
 

You should not take your AMLODIPINE (one of the medications for 
blood pressure) unless instructed to do so by your physician. 

Please call your doctor or come to the ED if you have fevers, 
chills, night sweats, chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, 
or any other concerning changes in your health.
