History of Present Illness:
 Ms. ___ is a ___ F with history of recently diagnosed high

presents with chest pain. She was supposed to be evaluated to 
start hospice services at home today but complained of these 
symptoms and came to the ED instead. Patient complains of 
increased urinary frequency starting last night that caused her

dull ___, that lasted a few minutes before resolving.  
.  
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.7 P 56 BP 147/54 R O2 sat 97% 
on 2L NC. Patient was given full dose aspirin. Her EKG was 
consistent with atrial fibrillation with questionable lateral ST 
depressions in V2/V5/V6. Her first set of cardiac enzymes were 
negative. CXR showed small bilateral pleural effusions, 
unchanged from prior. Cardiology was consulted, and both patient 
and cards said no intervention. She was admitted to medicine for 
management.  
.  
On the floor, she reports feeling well. She and her daughter

getting up to urinate. No further episodes of chest pain or 
discomfort.

Digoxin-1.___ year old female with history of high grade transitional cell 
cancer, DM, ___ and AF on coumadin who presents with chest pain. 
 
  
# Chest pain: She ruled out for MI with two sets of stable 
enzymes. After extensive goals of care discussion, patient and 
her daughter (HCP) would not want invasive treatment (ie cath) 
even if she did have a MI. The etiology of her chest pain is 
likely anxiety and fatigue. Her home statin and reduced dose of 
beta blocker were continued.  
 
# Atrial fibrillation: She has known atrial fibrillation and 
takes diltiazem and metoprolol at home for rate control as well 
as warfarin. Patient had brief asymptomatic episodes of 
bradycardia to the ___ and her dose of metoprolol was reduced. 
Her dose of warfarin was decreased to 2mg daily after an INR 
elevated to 3.8.
  
# Transitional cell carincoma: Patient has declined surgical 
resection and wishes to do home hospice care. She was supposed 
to initiate home hospice on the day of admission but ended up 
coming into hospital instead. After thorough discussion with 
help of palliative care, the patient and her daughter (her HCP) 
agreed that she would continue home hospice care after 
discharge.  
  
# Diabetes mellitus: While in the hospital, her oral agents were 
held and she was maintained on insulin sliding scale and lantus. 
 At discharge, her home regimen was resumed.
  
# Chronic renal insufficiency: Her creatinine remained within 
her recent baseline. Her chronic renal insufficiency is likely 
related to her underlying transitional cell carcinoma with left 
renal involvement.  
  
# Congestive Heart Failure: Patient EF >55% on TTE ___. She 
appeared euvolemic throughout admission.  
  
# COPD: She was continued on advair and combivent.

was continued on warfarin with INR goal 2.5-3.5.  Her dose of
