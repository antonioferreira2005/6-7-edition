IMAGING:
================
ECG (___):
Sinus rhythm. Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction, age 
undetermined. 
Inferolateral ST-T wave changes, likely due to left ventricular 
hypertrophy. Cannot exclude ischemia. No previous tracing 
available for comparison. 

CXR (___):
ET tube terminates 3.5 cm above Carina. Left IJ CVC terminates 
in the upper SVC. Inflated IABP is in appropriate position. 
Moderate to severe pulmonary edema and pleural effusions, 
probable CHF. 

TTE (___):
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
severely depressed with inferior and inferolateral akinesis and 
lateral hypokinesis (LVEF= ___ %). The right ventricular 
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely 
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve 
area <1.0cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction as 
described above. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle (a 
catheter is seen to traverse the RV towards the PA). Severely 
thickened aortic valve with likely severe stenosis - gradients 
are relatively low due to poor LV systolic dysfunction.  

CXR (___):
The previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in extent 
of the 
bilateral pleural effusions. Otherwise, the radiograph is 
unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly. Bilateral areas of 
atelectasis.  Moderate pulmonary edema. No pneumonia. No 
pneumothorax.

CXR (___):
Lung volumes have improved and previous bibasilar atelectasis 
and moderate pleural effusions have nearly cleared.  There is 
the suggestion of new consolidation in the right upper lung, 
where there was substantial 
consolidation on ___ raising possibility of recurrent 
pneumonia, often due to aspiration. Heart is normal size.

Carotid Ultrasound (___):
Less than 40% stenosis of bilateral ICA. 
  
Teeth Panorex (___): pending 

MICROBIOLOGY:
===================
-Sputum Cx (___): contaminant
-Blood Culture, Routine (Final ___: NO GROWTH x 2
-___ 3:35 pm SPUTUM Source: Endotracheal. 
GRAM STAIN (Final ___: 
  >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field. 
  2+ ___ per 1000X FIELD): GRAM POSITIVE COCCI. IN PAIRS AND 
CLUSTERS. 
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final ___: SPARSE GROWTH Commensal 
Respiratory Flora.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ M with known coronary artery disease elective cath ___ 
(patent stent in pLCx, severe mRCA disease, was revascularized 
at ___) now is transferred from outside hospital with mixed 
(cardiogenic/septic) shock ___ NSTEMI and presumed pneumonia. 

# Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: Multifactorial, initially 
due to pulmonary edema but persisted when swan numbers showed he 
was adequately diuresed. CXR showed mild bilateral infiltrates 
and was treated with cefepime for HCAP course. He was also given 
nebs PRN and continued to be diuresed with Lasix. The patient 
was weaned to room air at the time of discharge. 

# Cardiogenic shock ___ NSTEMI: Patient presented unstable with 
NSTEMI. Became hypotensive at OSH cath lab requiring IABP. He 
was placed on dobutamine and norepinephrine, however was weaned 
off IABP and pressors. No stent was placed. Patient was seen by 
cardiac surgery for revascularization and will see Dr. ___ as 
outpatient with plan for CABG in 1 month. He was continued on 
ASA, ___, and metoprolol and Plavix. Plavix will need to be held 
one week prior to CABG. 

# Acute decompensated systolic heart failure: TTE on ___ with 
EF ___ secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. He was diuresed 
aggressively and was transitioned to PO lasix upon discharge. He 
was continued on metoprolol and losartan.  
 
# New Paroxysmal Afib: CHADS = 3. Converted to sinus rhythm and 
was thought to be triggered by ischemia. He was started on 
amiodarone, continued on metoprolol and was kept on heparin gtt. 
He was discharged on Apixiban 5 mg PO BID and Metoprolol 
Succinate 150 mg PO Q12H. 

# Dysphagia: During his hospitalization, there was a concern for 
aspiration. The patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow and 
a video swallow was performed which was unremarkable for 
oropharyngeal dysphagia, but more concerning for esophageal 
dysmotility. The patient's diet was changed to regular with thin 
liquids. The patient was managed on an H2 blocker and will 
followup with gastroenterology at discharge. 

# Acute Kidney Injury: Baseline Cr 1.2 with admission Cr of 3.6. 
Etiology most likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension from 
cardiogenic shock vs cardiorenal from volume overload. After 
aggressive diuresis, Cr improved back to baseline. 

#Stage II Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: Patient was found to have a 
decubitus ulcer. Patient was evaluated by the wound nurse with 
___ precautions given.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted after a major heart attack and 
heart failure. You received life support and medical therapy in 
the cardiac ICU with improvement. The heart problems may have 
been exacerbated by the stress of your pneumonia, from which you 
are still recovering. Our cardiac surgeons felt that bypass 
surgery may be beneficial, and we recommend your breathing 
status and strength improve before undergoing this procedure.

Please see below for your medication changes. Please take your 
medications as instructed. Please followup with your primary 
care physician, ___, and heart surgeon. If you develop 
any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, 
or lower leg swelling, please medical attention urgently.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team
