Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of CAD (s/p PCI x16 
and CABG in ___ recent cardiac angiography with 80% stenosis 
OM1 and 70% stenosis LCx), HFpEF, pAfib (on eliquis), DM, HTN, 
HLD, and strong family history of CAD who presented to ___ 
___ with chest pain then transferred to ___ for further 
eval of unstable angina.

# Chest pain: 
Patient with worsening chest pain with exertion without EKG 
changes or trop, concerning for unstable angina. She was started 
on heparin and nitro gtt's. Upon admission she was chest pain 
free but developed CP with minimal exertion. Her home imdur was 
increased to 120mg daily and amlodipine was increased to 5mg 
daily. She underwent persantine MIBI which showed a partially 
reversible anteroseptal perfusion defect. However, her cath 
results from ___ (done at ___ 
did not correlate with the location of this perfusion defect. 
(Cath images were uploaded to ___ system and reviewed. There 
is some revascularization possible in the ___ territory but high 
risk and of questionable benefit. All grafts patent.) She was 
asymptomatic after medication optimization so we opted to 
proceed with that for now but if symtpoms recur rotablade and 
PCI of the LCx/OM can be considered and her films will be in 
Lifeimgae for our intevrentionalists to review. .

___ Cor angio report (___:
Severe 3VD, proximal and mid LAD have an 80% diffuse stenosis. 
OM1 with 80% ostial stenosis. Mid CX with 70% stenosis. OM2 with 
80% in-sttent restenosis. Distal CX is severely diffusely 
diseased and OM3 is totally occluded. The distal OM3 fills via a 
patent graft. RCA diffusely diseased with ostial and 80% 
stenosis in distal vessel. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] Lisinopril was decreased from 5mg BID to 5mg daily as she 
was normotensive after increasing her isosorbide mononitrate. 
Please check BP at followup and adjust as appropriate.
[ ] Amlodipine was increased from 2.5mg to 5mg daily
[ ] Isosorbide mononitrate extended-release was increased to 
120mg daily
[ ] If symptoms persist, please consider outpatient PCI for LCx 
disease
