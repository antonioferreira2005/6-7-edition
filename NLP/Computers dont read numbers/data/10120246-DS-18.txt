IMAGING:
========
LUMBO-SACRAL SPINE (AP & LAT) ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Similar destructive changes of the L2 and L3 vertebral bodies 
with  worsening collapse when compared to the prior CT from 
___ but unchanged from the recent MRI, compatible with 
known osteomyelitis/discitis. 
2. Status post L3 laminectomy, T11-L5 posterior fusion and L5-S1 
fusion with interbody spacer device without hardware 
complications or alignment change. 

CT L-SPINE W/O CONTRAST ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Worsening collapse of the L2-L3 vertebral bodies consistent 
with known 
extensive discitis/osteomyelitis.  Foci of gas within vertebral 
bodies has 
decreased from prior exam. 
2. Bilateral psoas calcified collections have decreased in size 
from prior 
exam. 
3. Stable post L3 laminectomy, T11 through L5 posterior spinal 
fusion, and 
L5-S1 fusion with interbody spacer device with no hardware 
complications. 

US LOWER BACK, SOFT TISSUE LEF ___
IMPRESSION:  
Large 10.9 x 1.5 x 3.7 cm complex fluid collection, difficult to 
ascertain 
relationship with the L3 laminectomy site, could represent 
normal postoperative changes, liquified hematoma or seroma, 
overall unchanged.  
Although there are no sonographic findings of superimposed 
infection, this 
should be clinically excluded.  If a CSF leak is of high 
clinical suspicion, Findings may be better assessed by MRI. 

US LOWER BACK, ___ GUIDED ASPIRATION/DRAINAGE ___
TECHNIQUE:  The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the 
procedure were 
explained to the patient.  After a detailed discussion, informed 
written 
consent was obtained.  A pre-procedure timeout using three 
patient identifiers was performed per ___ protocol. 
  
The patient was placed in a right lateral decubitus position on 
the US scan table. Limited preprocedure ultrasound was performed 
to localize the 
collection.  Based on the ultrasound findings an appropriate 
skin entry site for the aspiration was chosen.  The site was 
marked.  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% Lidocaine 
solution. 
  
Using continuous sonographic guidance, an 18 gauge spinal needle 
was inserted into the collection. 3 cc of serous fluid was 
aspirated.  Due to the loculated nature of the collection, no 
more fluid could be aspirated. 
  
Approximately 3 cc of serous fluid was aspirated with a sample 
sent for 
microbiology evaluation.  Sterile dressing was applied. 
  
The procedure was tolerated well, and there were no immediate 
post-procedural complications. 
  
SEDATION:  Moderate sedation was not provided 
  
FINDINGS:  
Approximately 3 cc of serous fluid was aspirated. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Successful aspiration of the superficial paraspinal lower back 
collection.  Sample was sent for microbiology evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of rheumatoid arthritis (on daily prednisone) 
and history of IV drug use (previously on suboxone), with recent 
admission in ___ for L2 epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, and 
discitis, s/p robotic laminectomy, washout, and fusion, who 
initially presented to an outside hospital with fevers and lower 
extremity weakness, subsequently transferred to ___, found to 
have L2-L3 discitis with concern for persistent spinal 
infection, ultimately discharged home against medical advice on 
___.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# L2-L3 Discitis with likely persistent spinal infection 
Initially presented to outside hospital with fevers and lower 
extremity pain/weakness. Underwent MRI that showed L2-L3 
discitis and several small areas of calcification vs. fluid 
collections in the psoas muscle, but with no drainable sites. 
After extensive review of imaging and discussion with both ID 
and orthopedic spine team, the decision made to keep existing 
hardware in place and defer surgical management. An ultrasound 
of her prior incision was obtained which showed liquefied 
hematoma vs. seroma.  ID recommended drainage for which ___ was 
consulted and performed drainage on ___ NSGY did not feel she 
required open surgical drainage. ID recommended treatment with 
prolonged course of vancomycin ___ weeks total) followed by 
suppressive treatment with TMP-SMX DS 1 tab BID indefinitely. 
The team recommended discharge to rehab to ensure patient 
received the appropriate treatment given concern that during her 
prior course of vancomycin, surveillance labs were not reliable 
obtained; however, patient declined.  Ms. ___ left against 
medical advice on ___ and expressed her plan to leave ___ 
___ and represent to ___ to receive remainder of her 
care.  A PICC was pulled before discharge on ___. She was 
provided with a prescription for TMP-SMX 1 DS tab BID.  Her 
outpatient ID doctor was notified of her leaving ___ and 
discharge summary faxed to office.  She should follow up with 
NSGY upon discharge.  She should follow up with ID upon 
discharge.  Cultures from her US guided aspiration from ___ 
were pending at time of leaving hospital. 

# ___, resolved
Mild pre-renal ___, with peak Cr of 0.9 (from baseline of 
0.5-0.6). Improved with hydration. 

# Opioid use disorder
Previously on suboxone but self-discontinued due to cost. Would 
be interested in re-starting this if it became more affordable. 
Social work was consulted during admission. Was not discharged 
from ___ on narcotics. 

# Transaminitis
Mild. Felt secondary to known Hepatitis C infection, for which 
the patient has not yet received treatment. Needs evaluation for 
treatment. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
# Rheumatoid arthritis
Maintained on chronic prednisone 60mg daily. Has not yet 
established care with rheumatology. Continued prednisone, 
pantoprazole 40mg daily, Vit D 800 IU daily, calcium carbonate 
1000mg qd and Bactrim daily for PJP prophylaxis. 

# Anxiety: Continued home clonazepam 1MG BID. Was not prescribed 
with BDZ upon discharge from ___. 

# COPD: Treated with Albuterol 0.083% Neb Soln 1 NEB IH Q4H:PRN 
SOB. 

# Tobacco abuse: Treated with nicotine Patch 21 mg/day TD DAILY.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital due to concern for an 
infection in your spine. 

In the hospital, you received IV antibiotics to treat your 
infection. Your MRI was reviewed with the radiologist, 
infectious disease doctors, and spine doctors, who all felt that 
you did not need a surgical procedure to treat your infection. 
You had an ultrasound of your incision which indicated that 
there was not a superimposed infection. 

You left the hospital against medical advice.  You had the 
capacity to make this decision.  You understood the risks of 
leaving the hospital including worsening spinal infection which 
could compromise your spinal cord, leading to paralysis or death 
or inability to walk.  You also may have a leak of your spinal 
fluid. 

Please take 1 tablet of Bactrim twice daily until you follow up 
with your doctors.

When you leave the hospital, you should continue taking all your 
medications, as prescribed. Please also attend all your 
follow-up appointments. 

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team
