ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:  
.  
# Acute Encepholapathy/Polypharmacy: Ms. ___ presented to the 
ED with AMS likely due to polypharmacy of her pain, sleeping, 
and anti-anxiety medications. She initially described taking 15 
pills of 5mg oxycodone at once but without intention of 
self-harm but later vehemently denied doing so. She was found to 
be somnolent but not requiring narcan and able to protect her 
airway. CT head, CXR, UA, and TSH were all negative or wnl's and 
her vital signs and exam were normal. Urine and serum toxicology 
was positive for opioids but otherwise negative. Her opioids, 
gabapentin, trazodone, mirtazapine, ambien, ativan, and 
pramipexole were held as she was observed and her mental status 
gradually improved. She then developed si/sx consistent with 
opioid and possibly benzo withdrawal, predmoninantly diffuse 
abdominal pain, nausea, and small volumes of watery emesis with 
minimal tenderness on exam without peritoneal signs and negative 
KUB x 2, mild, slowly uptrending leukocytosis, and negative 
lactates daily. She was evaluated by psych who felt her 
presentation could be consistent with withdrawal but that she 
lacked certain findings such as pupillary dilatation, yawning, 
and goose bumps. She was started back on decreased doses of her 
home pain medications, valium, gabapentin, and sleeping 
medications and her symptoms began to resolve. She was 
discharged on on her mirtazapine, valium (decreased dose), MS 
___ standing 12.5 BID, and pramipexole, PRN oxycodone (which 
will be filled in a separate vial per her pharmacy to avoid 
confusion, the rest of her medications will be filled in a 
bubble pack). Several hours were spent trying to obtain and 
confirm medications with patient, worked with pharmacist on team 
to optimize list, and contacted her outpatient pharmacy to have 
bubble packs and only one PRN bottle. ___ has been instructed to 
remove all old medications, and monitor her pill intake so as to 
avoid accidental misuse of her medications. She was set up with 
outpatient follow-up with her PCP and her cognitive 
neuropsychiatrist.  
.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:
.  
# Chronic Pain: Pt has chronic low back pain and multiple low 
back surgeries requiring admissions for pain control in the 
past. She was treated with standing tylenol, lidocaine patch, 
and topical capsaicin but was ultimately placed on lower doses 
of her current pain regimen as above.
.  
# Hypertension: Stable. Continued home amlodipine and atenolol.  

.  
# GERD: Stable. Continued on her home omeprazole. 
.  
# Dry mouth: Stable. Her home oral elixirs including those 
containing lidocaine and diphenhydramine were held for concerns 
of accumulate in the elderly and AMS.  
.  
# Parkinsonian Tremor: Pt was without tremor on exam. Her home 
pramipexole was held for concerns that it may have been 
contributing to her AMS, but restarted prior to discharge and 
patient was stable.  
.  
# Diet Controlled Diabetes: Stable. Maintained on a conservative 
HISS in-house. 
.  
# Glaucoma: Stable. Continued on her home eye drops.  
.  
# Hyperlipidemia: Stable. Continued on her home simvastatin.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1) Polypharmacy: Pt had consilidation of her outpatient 
medications. Her outpatient pharmacy was contacted in order to 
have bubble packs prepared and one PRN vial (oxycodone) for her 
opiods. Patient will have ___ to assist with medications, 
instructions to remove all previous meds and monitor her pill 
intake. 
2) Patient has follow up with PCP and cognitive 
neuropsychiatrist. PCP made aware of several medication changes.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
.
It was a pleasure taking care of you. You were admitted to ___ 
for evaluation and treatment of altered mental status, 
sleepiness, and confusion. You had a CT scan of your head which 
did not show anything harmful, and tests looking for infections 
or other causes for your confusion. It seems that you had taken 
too many pain medications at the same time which made you very 
sleepy and confused.
.
There has been a lot of confusion surrounding your medications 
that you were taking at home, and we have made several 
adjustments to your medications. We are recommending to the 
nurse that takes care of you to clear out all of your 
medications, and we will be starting you on these medications 
from now on.

We have recommended for your visiting nurse to completely remove 
all of your medications from your house, as you will be starting 
on this new medication regimen that has worked well for you in 
the hospital.
.
Please follow-up with the appointments below.
