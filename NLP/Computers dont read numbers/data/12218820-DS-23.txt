History of Present Illness:
___ w/ PMH of Whipple for benign pancreatic mass, GERD, COPD, 
several lumbar spine surgeries, and a recent compression 
fracture, who is admitted for back pain. She reports onset of 
pain after lifting something awkwardly while doing laundry about 
two weeks ago. The pain is stabbing in quality and is located in 
her R flank, overlying most of the ___ through 11th ribs. The 
pain is worsened by moving and she has been increasingly just 
lying still trying not to move. Partially helped by taking large 
doses of acetaminophen. She denies any dysuria, any 
fevers/chills, or any association with food intake. The pain 
eventually became so bad that her daughter took her to the ___ 
for evaluation.

She presented to ___ where a CT spine revealed various 
chronic thoracic and lumbar spine fractures from T8 through L1 
level. She was transferred to ___ ___ for neurosurgical 
evaluation. In the ___ ___, neurosurgery was consulted and 
after examining the patient and reviewing the CT, they felt that 
the pain was unrelated to the fractures - which appeared chronic 
- and recommended workup for medical causes of back pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ frailty, chronic compression fractures coming with back 
pain in setting of deconditioning and increased activity. Had 
hospitalization in ___ at ___ for back pain after 
over-straining (attempted to pull a trash can), then went to 
___, then home with ___. ___nded, patient again 
tried over-exerting herself with 3 days of cooking in 
preparation for ___. Also not sleeping (~3 hours/night) and 
eating poorly. Came in with recurrent back pain to ___, 
where CT showed what were initially thought to be new 
compression fractures at T9-10, and she was transferred here. 
Neurosurgery evaluated and thought that her fractures were 
chronic in nature and pain was unrelated. Pain is spastic in 
T9-10 distribution in paraspinal muscles, coming in waves. 
Suspect muscular spasm from compensating after injury.

#Back pain, right sided flank pain
Thought to be ___ muscular strain from compensating after 
compression fractures, in setting of deconditioning (due to 
weight loss) and significant exertion.  Significant pain over 
right side, rib series negative for fracture, CT A/P showing ___ 
acute abnormalities.  She was put on standing Tylenol, PRN 
Tramadol, lidocaine patches, baclofen and gabapentin.  Pain 
service consulted and due to frailty they did not recommend any 
further adjustments in regimen at this time.  Concern there is 
an anxiety component to her symptoms as her son reports whenever 
she is getting ready to leave the hospital her symptoms worsen.
