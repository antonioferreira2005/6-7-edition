Imaging: 
___ CXR: Exam is limited due to patient body habitus and 
poor inspiratory effort. Given these limitations, no definite 
focal consolidation, pneumothorax, pneumonia, or effusion/edema. 
Mild streaky atelectasis is noted within the retrocardiac 
region. Right upper lobe and right hila granulomas is stable. 
Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within the aortic arch 
and descending aorta. Included portion of the upper abdomen 
appears unremarkable. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: ___ F with know hx of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, 
esophageal varices w/ banding, IDDM, and HTN, who presents with 
chest pain for a duration of approximately 30 minutes, resolved 
in the ED with NTG. R/o for AMI by EKG and 2 sets neg CE. 
.
#Chest pain, sub-sternal: These episodes have happened ___ 
times, per family, sometimes at rest, sometimes with ambulation, 
so there is a question that she might have worsening cardiac 
disease. The patient was ruled out for MI by 2 sets of negative 
cardiac enzymes, and the proBNP not elevated (298). There is 
question of medication compliance as the patient's BP has been 
elevated recently. It is recommended that the patient have an 
outpatient stress test MIBI through her PCP.
.
#DM type 2 - insulin dependent: There is question of poor 
compliance as evidenced by HgbA1c at >9.0, and the patient and 
family describing altered dosing regimen depending on the 
patient's status. She explains that there are times where she 
thinks there is too much insulin, which makes her "feel bad". At 
times she takes less than is prescribed.
.
#HTN: We continued her home dose of lisinopril.
.
#Cryptogenic liver disease: We continued her home dose of 
propranalol. The patient's daughter states that the patient only 
takes it BID, as opposed to TID.
.
The patient remained stable throughout her course. She was 
discharged with strict instructions for follow-up and symptom 
surveillance. Her son was spoken with at length and agrees with 
plan. He will try to encourage adherence.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for chest pain.  Two sets of 
cardiac enzymes showed no sign you were having a heart attack 
and your EKG was unchanged from before.  Your chest xray did not 
show any sign of pneumonia or heart failure.  Your pain was most 
likely related to acid reflux, but it could also be related to 
heart disease.
.
Please follow up with your PCP within one week - earlier is 
better. You will probably need to have a repeat stress test as 
an outpatient to look at your heart function. It is extremely 
important that you follow up with your PCP, as you could have a 
life-threatening problem that needs treatment.
.
Your medications were not changed, but you need to take ALL of 
them EXACTLY as prescribed. The medications do not work properly 
or may be harmful to you if you do not use them as directed, 
especially your blood pressure medications and insulin. Your 
blood sugar in the hospital was high, and it is important that 
you do not alter your dose at home because you do not have 
adequate control over it at this time.
.
You should call your PCP urgently or return to the ED if you 
experience worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or any 
other concerning symptoms. You were given a prescription for 
nitroglycerine to put under your tongue when you have chest 
pain. Please take this medication if you have more chest pain 
and return to the Emergency Department right away if your pain 
is not resolved with nitroglycerine, especially if it is before 
you meet with your PCP.
.
All of these instructions were related to your son, ___. He 
will help you follow up with the outpatient instructions.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
