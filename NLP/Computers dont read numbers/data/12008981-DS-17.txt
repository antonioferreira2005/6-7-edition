History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF THE PRESENTING ILLNESS:  
___ with a history of essential tremor, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, PTSD, HTN, who presents with worsening tremor and
memory problems.

Patient reports that for months he has had worsening memory,
noticed by his wife, and will have episodes where he completely
forgets the events of a specific period of time and will have to
be reminded of things that happened. He notes for example that 
he
recently had a fall (no LOC or headstrike) that he did not 
recall
when his wife asked him about the following day. He also feels
like in the past several months his tremor has been increasing 
in
severity, and is interfering with his daily activities more, to
the point where he is having difficulty doing ADLs. He is
scheduled for bilateral knee replacement surgery, but is 
awaiting
neuro consult before surgery. Patient also notes ongoing 
diarrhea
that he relates to one of his medications, though he is not sure
which. Finally, notes BRBPR that he primarily notices on toilet
paper, which he attributes to hemorrhoids and Coumadin. He has 
no
visual changes, fevers/chills, chest pain, dyspnea,
nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, or dysuria.

The patient came to the ED at the encouragement from an
outpatient physician when he attended an appointment for an INR
check, with the intention of having an expedited neurology
evaluation. In the ED, initial vitals were: T 97.8 HR 59 BP
119/91 RR 15 O2 sat 98% RA. Exam notable for: resting tremor 
jaw,
intention tremor L>R upper extremities, and rectal exam with
visible bleeding, external hemorrhoids.

Labs notable for:  INR 3.3, Hgb 15.1, ALT 46/AST 51
Imaging was notable for:  CTH without acute abnormality, with
enlarged ventriles, normal CXR

Patient was seen by neurology, who felt that memory issues ___
inattention in the setting of worsening PTSD and alcohol use, 
and
recommended starting propranolol for tremor. Neurology did not
feel that inpatient neurology workup was warranted. Patient was
given 5 mg diazepam once prior to admission to the floor.

Upon arrival to the floor, patient reports continued tremor but
otherwise feeling well. Endorses history above, and reports that
he feels generally at his baseline but that his tremors are
becoming worse and are preventing him from functioning

ROS: Positive per HPI. Remaining 10 point ROS reviewed and
negative

memory problems. 

# Memory deficits
Patient was alert and fully oriented during the hospitalization. 
Patient endorses history of "blackouts" and memory problems as 
far back as ___. He also reports a slow, intermittent decline 
in his cognitive function. He states deficits occur sporadically 
and some days he feels no change. Other than his intention 
tremor, he denies any new or acute neurologic symptoms. 
Neurological exam significant only for for tremor, and head CT 
without acute process. No focalized or signs or symptoms of 
active infections. Per neurology team evaluation, low suspicion 
for new neurological process causing memory deficit. Memory loss 
could be in the setting of concomitant alcohol and 
benzodiazepine use, as well as stress with multiple friends 
passing away recently. TSH 0.90 on ___, and B12 and folic acid 
levels were ordered. Patient will be follow up with neurology in 
the outpatient setting on ___. 

# Essential tremors
Patient with essential tremors since he was a ___. His 
grandfather also had these tremors. They used to come and go' 
however, they have been progressively getting worse especially 
over the last year, and are now continuous. Tremors are worse in 
his right compared to his left, and are triggered by decreased 
sleep and increased anxiety along with physical activity. Per 
neurology recommendations, atenolol was stopped and propranolol 
10mg qd was started for the management of essential tremors. 
Patient reports improvement with the change of medication on day 
of discharge. OT evaluated him and he should see them as an 
outpatient.

#Rectal bleeding 
Patient with a medical history of hemorrhoids and warfarin use 
for Afib. He has bleeding from his hemorrhoids during the last 
month. Patient with external hemorrhoids on physical exam 
without signs of active bleeding. No history of melena to 
suggest UGIB. Patient hemodynamically stable without evidence of 
anemia.

# Transaminitis
Patient with moderate intake of alcohol, and mildly elevated 
transaminases with normal albumin and mild thrombocytopenia. 
Transaminitis not significantly changed since ___. Improved 
upon repeat. 

# Atrial fibrillation on Warfarin:
On atenolol, propefone. CHADS2-VASC = 1; on warfarin. S/P DC 
cardioversion in ___ sinus rhythm noted on admission. Will 
start propranolol in place of atenolol for tremor control

# Alcohol/BZD use use: 
Patient reports that tremors are better when drinking 3 glasses 
of wine per night along with Valium. Denies history of alcohol 
withdrawal symptoms and he did not score on the CIWA scale. 
Discussed importance of minimizing alcohol use, and not taking 
valium at same time as he has been drinking alcohol. Recommended 
close follow up with his therapist, psychiatrist and PCP for 
further management. 

# Depression
# Anxiety
# PTSD
Patient with a history of violent childhood and PTSD and is 
currently on Wellbutrin. Stress may be exacerbating his tremors 
and alcohol/BZD intake. Plan for follow up as above. 

# HTN:
- Continued home lisinopril

# HLD: 
- Continued home pravastatin

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
[] Patient will have outpatient OT script and should follow up 
with them for his essential tremor.
-Consider outpatient abdominal imaging to evaluate for 
steatohepatitis and transaminitis. LFT have been stable from 
baseline but consider repeat. 
-Atenolol was stopped and propranolol 10mg daily was started for 
the management of essential tremors. Neurology will titrate this 
medication as needed.
[] Rectal Hemorrhoids: Please re-evaluate rectal 
bleeding/hemorrhoids.
[] Cognitive Decline and Memory Issues: Follow up with 
outpatient neurologist on ___. Consider a neuropsychological 
evaluation to assess degree of cognitive decline 
[] PTSD/Depression/Anxiety: Patient should follow up with 
outpatient psychiatrist and adjustments to his psychiatry 
medications, especially for anxiety and his benzo use.
[] Please follow up B12, folate 
-Follow up with outpatient psychotherapist
