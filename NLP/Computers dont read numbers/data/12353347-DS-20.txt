Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with a history of Stage IIa breast cancer and 
hypothyroidism who presents with a chief complaint of diarrhea 
and fever. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Febrile Neutropenia: She was febrile to 101.8F on the day 
prior to admission. She had been having diarrhea since her last 
chemotherapy session about 1 week earlier. Blood and urine 
cultures were obtained and she was started on broad spectrum 
antibiotics (vanc and meropenem). Her chest x-ray was 
unremarkable. Antibiotics were stopped when she arrived on the 
floor. Urine cultures obtained in the ER grew out E. Coli that 
was resistant to Bactrim. She initially remained afebrile but 
her low grade fevers were likely being masked by the ibuprofen 
and Tylenol she was taking for bone pain. She had a low grade 
fever of 100.5F on ___ once the ibuprofen and Tylenol were 
stopped. She was restarted on meropenem and remained afebrile. 
Repeat blood and urine cultures were obtained. The second set of 
urine cultures showed no growth. Of note, she had no episodes of 
diarrhea during this admission. She also developed a dry cough. 
Repeat chest x-ray was negative and the cough resolved prior to 
discharge.   
  
# Neutropenia: Likely secondary to recent chemotherapy. WBC 
count was up-trending after two doses of Neupogen. 

# Pelvic bone pain: Common after she receives chemo. Bone pain 
has resolved with oxycodone. She will continue ibuprofen and 
Tylenol on discharge. 

INACTIVE ISSUES: 
# Stage IIa Breast cancer s/p bilateral masectomy and recent 
chemotherapy with Nabpaclitaxel and Cytoxan. Her nausea was 
controlled with Zofran, Compazine and Marinol.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine.
# OSA: Did not require night-time CPAP during this admission.
