Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the urology service and 
Interventional Radiology consultation requested. After obtaining 
clearance from the Transplant Surgery service, a right PCNU tube 
was placed on the afternoon ___ (HD 2). We additionally 
consulted transplant nephrology who recommended holding his 
furosemide and ___ in the setting of his acutely elevated 
creatinine. The morning after PCNU placement, his Foley catheter 
was removed and the PCNU capped. Unfortunately he developed 
severe pelvic pain and on evaluation was found to have a 
displacement of his PCNU, which had been pulled back such that 
there was no functioning ureteral component. A Foley catheter 
placed from below yielded no urine and his Cr climbed to 1.9 
from 1.5. The PCN tube was uncapped, draining a large amount of 
urine, and the patient experienced relief of his discomfort with 
an improvement of his Cr to 1.6. He was taken back by ___ the 
following day ___, HD 3) for replacement and repositioning of 
the PCNU by ___. He was discharged home that afternoon in good 
condition, with instructions to follow up with his nephrologist 
for a creatinine check in ___ days and a plan to return for a 
definitive antegrade stone procedure in two to four weeks.
