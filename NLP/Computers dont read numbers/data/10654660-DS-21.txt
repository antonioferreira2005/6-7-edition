History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ year old woman with DLBCL germinal 
center type of the right pterygopalatine fossa on R-CHOP who is 
admitted from clinic with facial pain.

Patient was recently admitted ___ to ___ following 
profound weakness and fall at home following C3 R-CHOP. She was 
initially treated with cefepime for presumed febrile 
neutropenia, but ultimately found to have enterococcal UTI 
treated with 7 days of ampicillin. She underwent C4 R-CHOP while 
inpatient on ___ and she was discharged to rehab on ___ 
with plan to forgo opioid
analgesics given fall risk. Home Lasix and HCTZ were also held.

Since discharge, she has been doing relatively well at rehab, 
and she does not recall having any pain at rehab. However, the 
evening prior to admission, she developed relatively quick onset 
severe right jaw pain. Morning of admission, pain became 
unbearable, and also affected her tongue. She was seen in 
clinic, and was given 2mg PO dilaudid, gabapentin 300mg, 5mg 
prednisone, 650mg Tylenol,
and IVF prior to direct admission for further management.

On arrival, patient reports good initial relief with the pain 
medications administered. Her jaw pain was down to ___, however 
it intermittently worsened to ___. The pain was not 
exacerbated by chewing or speaking, but the patient did report 
cold sensitivity. No dysphagia or dysphonia noted. Patient 
denies headache, rhinitis, fevers, or chills. Of note, the 
patient did have a root
canal prior to her diagnosis of lymphoma. Otherwise, the patient 
feels well. She denies CP, SOB, or cough. No N/V. She did have 
some diarrhea last week at rehab that was treated with immodium. 
She denies diarrhea currently and her last BM was normal. No 
dysuria. No new leg pain but mild leg edema that has been 
stable.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
A complete 10-point review of systems was performed and was 
negative unless otherwise noted in the HPI.
 
Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
___ developed R sided facial/tooth pain attributed to recent 
root canal.  Saw her PCP ___ after a fall with a lump on the 
R temple, decreased hearing  on the R, and dizziness. 

___ she went to the ___ where head/neck CT and MRI 
showed a "large right pterygoid space malignant tumor invading 
the floor of right middle cranial fossa, right greater wing of 
sphenoid and floor of right sphenoid sinus, partially destroying 
the right medial and lateral pterygoid plates, protruding into  
the right nasopharynx, oropharynx, and upper right hypopharynx, 
encasing the proximal right external carotid artery. She was
transferred to ___ and further workup included a fiberoptic
exam with ENT which demonstrated a smooth mass protruding into

IMAGING:
========
___ SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXIL
1. No evidence of enlarging soft tissue mass within the right 
masticator
space. No osseous erosion of the right mandibular condyle were 
glenoid fossa.
2. Continued decrease size of right masticator space mass, with 
residual
effacement of the right parapharyngeal, pterygopalatine fossa 
and trigeminal fat pad fat.
3. Interval resolution of right mastoid air cell and middle ear 
opacification, presumably secondary to resolution of mass effect 
on the right Eustachian tube.
4. No new osseous lesion.  Additional findings as described 
above.

___ SKULL BASE W&W/O CO
1. Prominent interval decrease in size of an enhancing mass 
centered in the right masticator space/pterygopalatine fossa as 
compared to ___.  Residual effacement of the 
pterygopalatine fossa fat pad with areas of signal abnormality 
and non masslike enhancement within the pterygopalatine fossa 
and right masticator space with extension through foramen ovale 
and rotundum and bony involvement of the right sphenoid bone, 
petrous portion of the temporal bone as well as the clivus, 
corresponding to permeated areas on concurrent CT examination.  
The masticator space enhancement extends to the right 
temporomandibular joint.  These findings could represent any 
combination of residual tumor and post treatment sequela.  
Continued attention on follow up examination is advised.
2. Apparent edema and enhancement of the right inferior alveolar 
nerve without asymmetric expansion or nodularity.  There is also 
enhancing STIR hyperintense signal in the right sublingual space 
adjacent to the mandible.  This may represent inflammatory 
change, however visual tumor in treatment sequela is also 
possible.  Clinical correlation with nature of right jaw pain is 
recommended.
3. No acute intracranial abnormality.
4. Moderate global atrophy and areas of white matter signal 
abnormality in a configuration suggestive of chronic small 
vessel ischemic disease.
5. Mild paranasal sinus disease and mild opacification of the 
right mastoid air cells, as described, decreased compared to 
prior examinations.

PET-CT ___:
IMPRESSION:  
No suspicious FDG uptake is identified. Previously noted areas 
of 
signal abnormality in the right pterygopalatine fossa and 
masticator space on prior MR do not demonstrate abnormal FDG 
avidity.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old woman with DLBCL germinal 
center type of the right pterygopalatine fossa, s/p C4 R-CHOP 
who is admitted from clinic with facial pain. She was found to 
have inflammation of the right inferior alveolar nerve and 
petrous/clival abnormality on MRI concerning for possible 
residual tumor treated with high dose MTX on ___. MTX cleared as 
of ___ and leucovorin was dc'ed.

# Facial pain
# Mucositis: 
CT and MRI showed interval decrease in size of PPF mass but 
residual enhancement involving base of the skull as well as R 
inferior alveolar nerve. She was treated with high dose MTX on 
___. Patient continued to endorse ongoing mouth 
soreness/difficulty swallowing, likely secondary to mucositis 
from high-dose methotrexate. She was continued on magic 
mouthwash, gabapentin ___. Hydromorphone PCA was started 
on ___ and gelclair was added on ___. Her PCA was 
subsequently transitioned to 5 mg oxycodone PRN. She was 
additionally treated with caphosol 30 mL ORAL QID mucositis. 
Patient's pain regimen was tapered due to altered mental status 
and increased confusion. Her PCA and oxycodone were stopped and 
her gabapentin dose was lowered to 100 mg BID. Due to her mouth 
pain and severe malnutrition, she was initiated on TPN. Patient 
was weaned off of TPN on ___ in setting of increased PO intake. 


#DLBCL, germinal center type, clinically localized to right 
pterygopalatine fossa. Patient has received 4 cycles of R-CHOP. 
She completed one cycle of HD-MTX during this admission. PET-CT 
on ___ showed no suspicious FDG uptake and previously noted 
areas of signal abnormality in the right pterygopalatine fossa 
and masticator space on previous MRI were without abnormal FDG 
avidity. MTX cleared as of ___ and leucovorin was dc'ed. 
Patient was discharged to rehab with plans to follow-up with ___ in ___ for outpatient radiation evaluation and 
treatment. The appointment date/time were pending at discharge, 
and patient's husband/rehab facility will be contacted when an 
appointment is made.

#Acute cystitis- Patient with urine culture growing E.coli. She 
was initially treated with CTX (d1= ___ that was transitioned 
to PO cefpodoxime at discharge(last day= ___.

and purulent exudate on ___ with complaints of foreign body 
sensation and irritation. Based on optho recs, started she was 
treated with erythromycin ointment BID x 5 days (___).
Conjunctival erythema and exudate resolved with the above 
treatment. Ophthalmology recommended that patient follow up 
non-urgently as an outpatient to assess refraction and cataract 
status.

#Toenail pain- Patient with toenails on b/l feet that are 
lifting off likely secondary to MTX administration. Evaluated by 
podiatry and found to have no signs of infection. Hallux toenail 
was trimmed with scissors and a betadine dressing was placed to 
cover the toenail. Left toenails were covered with a gauze 
dressing for comfort. 

#Panyctopenia: Likely from treatment of her DLBCL. She was 
transfused as needed to maintain Hg>7, and she received 3 pRBC 
transfusions during this admission.

#Depression: Evaluated by psych during her last admission. 
Patient was continued on most recent regimen of paroxetine and 
bupropion.

#Hypothyroidism: continued home levothyroxine

#HTN: Lasix and HCTZ were held during last hospitalization and 
were not resumed during this admission, as patient was mostly 
normotensive.

#HLD: Home simvastatin was held.
