History of Present Illness:
___ w SLE on low dose pred/hydroxychloroquine, recent B
breast reduction who presents with fever. Patient had
uncomplicated B breast reduction surgery for dorsalgia on ___
(___) and had been healing from that. She has been taking APAP
daily for pain and over the last few days has had worsening
erythema around both breasts without discharge but with
increasing pain and warmth in that area. Day prior to admission
was feeling well but suddenly began having HA (frontal/temporal)
without photophobia or significant neck stiffness. This is
similar to her usual HAs but much more prominent. She took APAP
and ibuprofen and cool pack but still felt HA and temp was 99.6
after the meds. She also tried increasing her home pred to 4mg.
She also had an episode of nausea and vomiting in the car on 
ride
to hospital, though she thinks that could have been motion
sickness (non bloody, threw up her banana). 
She denies confusion, vision changes, mouth pain, tooth pain,
rhinorrhea (beyond baseline), cough, wheeze, chest pain, abd
pain, diarrhea, dysuria, joint pain (beyond slight worsening of
baseline hip and back pain), joint swelling, other rash. 
She endorses worsening of her back pain when she had the HA but
without ___ weakness/numbness. She also reports worsening of her
baseline hip pain (which is in her greater trochnateric bursa).
She does not feel like she is having a lupus flare. 

In ED, initial vitals 96.7 109 115/77 16 99%RA. Temp rose to 101
(with HR 77). Vitals remained AVSS otherwise. Noted to be tired
appearing. CXR, BCx, labs, LP (0 WBCs, 0 RBCs), breast
ultrasound. Put on vanc/CTX empirically for meningitis. Plastics
consulted. Admitted to medicine.

She reports that since being in the ED the erythema on her 
breast
is less prominent and she has clearance of her HA and feeling
better.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Sepsis
# Cellulitis
Presented with fever and leukocytosis along with breast erythema 
and warmth consistent with cellulitis after recent breast 
reduction surgery. Had some back pain and trochanteric bursae 
pain but these were minor and thought to be secondary to fever 
rather than primary. CXR and UA were unremarkable. She was 
reporting severe headache in the ED and as a result underwent an 
LP which was negative for pleocytosis.
She was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone. US of the breasts 
revealed bilateral fluid collections. She was followed by 
plastic surgery during the hospital stay who felt that the fluid 
collections represented post-op seromas with no concern for 
abscess at this time.
Her fevers and leukocytosis resolved on IV antibiotics and she 
was transitioned to Bactrim and Keflex to complete a 10 day 
course finishing on ___.

# SLE: c/b sicca syndrome, not apparently flaring and otherwise 
in remission. Increased home prednisone 2mg po qd to 6mg daily 
for three days while ill. She was restarted on home dose of 2mg 
at discharge

# GERD: continued home PPI (note is BID, can consider decreasing 
as an outpatient)

# Rhinitis, glaucoma, cataracts, allergies: continued home eye 
drops and allergy meds and held home azelastine as non-formulary

# Depression
Continued home duloxetine

> 30 minutes spent on discharge coordination and planning

Transitional Issues:
====================
- discharged on Bactrim and Keflex for a 10 day course finishing 
on ___
- note that patient is taking pilocarpine BID rather than QID as 
prescribed due to hot flashes/sweating with the medicine. 
Advised pt to resumed QID but to discuss with her outpatient 
providers to see if BID is reasonable
- note that patient is on BID PPI, can consider decreasing to QD 
or weaning if able given risks

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you. You were admitted for fever. 
We think this is from a skin infection after your breast surgery 
(cellulitis) for which you were treated with antibiotics. 
Please complete the course of antibiotics as prescribed.

If you notice that the redness is returning or getting worse, 
please call your primary doctor or return to the ED.

It was a pleasure taking care of you, and we are happy that 
you're feeling better!
