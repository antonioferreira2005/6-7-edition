___: 
The left atrium is dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left 
atrium or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular

function is low normal (LVEF ___. [Intrinsic left 
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the 
severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is considerable

ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall 
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally

stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
myxomatous. There is moderate/severe posterior (P2) leaflet 
mitral valve prolapse and anterior leaflet billowing. Severe

The patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving epinephrine (0.03 
mcg/kg/min), milrinone (0.125 mcg/kg/min) and phenylephrine

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where the 
patient underwent A ___ Maze procedure with left atrial 
appendage resection and mitral valve repair with plication of 
posterior mitral leaflet and placement of a 30 ___ 
II annuloplasty ring. Overall the patient tolerated the 
procedure well and ___ was transferred to the CVICU 
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 
found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing 
comfortably. The patient was neurologically intact and 
hemodynamically stable. Beta blocker was initiated and the 
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. She 
remained in sinus rhythm for the remainder of her hospital 
course on Lopressor and Amiodarone per MAZE protocol. The 
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without 
complication. Coumadin was started for atrial fibrillation 
(Eliquis preop) and INR became supratherapeutic after 1 dose. 
She required a dose of Vitamin K x 2 for INR 5.0. It had 
decreased to INR 1.7. Coumadin dose was reduced to 1 mg for INR 
goal ___ patient was evaluated by the physical therapy 
service for assistance with strength and mobility. By the time 
of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the 
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. 
Oxycodone was changed to Ultram per patient request ___ to 
feeling "spacey" with Oxycodone. The patient was discharged home 
with visiting nurse services in good condition with appropriate 
follow up instructions. Coumadin will be followed up with the 
cardiac surgery office until follow up can be arranged with PCP.
