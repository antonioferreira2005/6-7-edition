hypoxia
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
___ year ___ speaking man w/ hx of DM, ESRD on HD who 
presents with intermittent hypoxia
.
Patient was recently admitted to ___ for hypoxia and was 
initially thought to have pneumonia, covered broadly for HCAP 
(had prior ICU admission requiring biPAP). He was later thought 
to have volume overload/bronchitis, abx were narrowed to 
levofloxacin, and he completed 7-day course today. He was sent 
to the ED form rehab
this morning for CTA to rule out PE due to his hypoxia. 
.
Patient presents today with his daughter, who reports that 
patient has had oxygen desaturation into the ___ at rehab 
intermittently since starting HD. Hypoxic events are not 
precipitated by identifiable causes, no relation to exertion, 
eating, position. Pt appears short of breath during these times 
and responds to oxygen (2L) with saturations climbing to mid 
___. Patient also has had productive cough for past week, not 
worse with lying down or post-prandial, but patient is unclear 
of sputum color. Reports chills upon transport but none prior. 
Denies fevers, chest pain, pain on inspiration, orthopnea, PND, 
calf pain, asymmetric lower extremity edema, sick contacts. At 
baseline, patient has mild abdominal distention and lower 
extremity edema in between HD sessions that resolves after. He 
uses a cane for walking and has mild dizziness when going from 
sitting to standing, worse after HD. Pt also reports occasional 
tightness in the abdomen, unrelated to eating.       
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were T 97.9 HR 74 BP ___ RR 16 
O2 94% on 2L NC. He underwent EKG, CXR, and CTA, which was 
negative for PE. His labs were notable for troponin of 0.16 
(consistent with baseline, 0.12-0.14 in recent admission), WBC 
8.6, HCt 30.7 (baseline), glucose 214, Cr 6.0 (5.4-6.2 on 
previous admission), lactate 2.1. On transfer, vital signs were 
T 98.1 HR 67 BP 109/42 RR 22 O2 96% on 2L NC. 
.
Currently patient is comfortable on 2 L and remains so on RA. He 
has no complaints 
.  
ROS: Denies fever, night sweats, headache, vision changes, 
rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, chest pain, abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, 
hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

CXR ___: FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest 
were obtained. Large bore 
right-sided central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial 

junction/proximal right atrium. No pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax is seen.  
The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal 
and hilar 
contours are stable. No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
.
CTA ___:
 
Preliminary ReportThe thyroid gland is unremarkable. There is no 
axillary or mediastinal 
Preliminary Reportlymphadenopathy by CT size criteria. The heart 
and great vessels are 
Preliminary Reportunremarkable. There are minimal left anterior 
descending coronary artery 
Preliminary Reportcalcifications. Also noted are mitral annular 
calcifications. There are mild

Brief Hospital Course:
#HYPOXIA: Pt reportedly intermittently hypoxic to ___ and ___. 
There was concern for PE at rehab and patient sent for CTA. CTA 
negative so PE unlikely. No obvious pneumonia or fluid overload 
on CXR or CT.  Most likely etiology is a poor O2 saturation 
recording on the monitor secondary to his finger clubbing and 
nail fungus.  When the pulse oximeter was adjusted his sats 
improved.  An additional portable pulse oximeter was used and 
showed stable oxygen saturations on room air without desat.  
.
#CKD: Pt currently undergoes HD on T, Th, and S. Cr 6.0 on 
admission, stable from previous admission.  He received dialysis 
on ___ which was uncomplicated.  His amlodipine was held to 
allow more blood pressure room to remove fluid
.
# DM:  Continued lantus and sliding scale
.
#HTN: Stable.  Held amlodpine on discharge, but maintained home 
lasix
.
#ANEMIA: Stable from previous admissions. Received ferrous 
gluconate during HD
.
