CT LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: 
  
At the site of foreign body extraction, there is a large, 
approximately 3.7 x 
1.7 x 1.7 cm osseous defect within the proximal tibia at the 
metadiaphysis, 
which does not involve the tibial articular surface (2:40, 
450A:42). There is 
associated interruption of the cortex at the anteromedial aspect 
of the tibia, 
where tiny locules of gas are seen. There is overlying soft 
tissue defect of 
skin and fat, with packing at the site of surgical debridement. 
The defect 
extends up to, but does not breach, the posterior tibial cortex. 
No other 
sbony injury is detected. The patellar tendon appears 
essentially intact, 
consistent with the history of surgical repair. There is 
expected surrounding 
soft tissue edema. A tiny subcentimeter locule of fat is seen 
within the 
patellofemoral joint (2:14). 
  
The distal tibia and fibula appear normal. The ankle mortise 
intact and 
appears normal. Incidental note is made of an approximately 1.1 
x 0.9 x 0.5 cm 
intraosseous lipoma of the middle portion of the calcaneus 
(450A:61, 451B:46). 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Proximal tibial osseous and soft tissue defects at site of 
foreign body 
extraction, extending up tp, but not breaching, the posterior 
tibial cortex, 
with surrounding soft tissue edema. 
  
2. Intraosseous lipoma of calcaneus incidentally noted.

 LEFT KNEE, TWO VIEWS: An 81 x 11 mm radiopaque foreign body is 
seen embedded 
within the proximal tibial metaphysis. The object enters the 
bone obliquely 
and measures approximately 1.5 cm at the site of entry. There 
appears to be 
associated subcutaneous air along the proximal shin; however, 
this is 
difficult to definitively visualize due to overexposure of the 
soft tissue 
components. No joint effusion is seen in the suprapatellar 
space. The rest 
of the visualized bony structures appear within normal limits. 
  
IMPRESSION: Foreign object embedded within the proximal tibial 
metaphysis. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___:  To OR by Ortho trauma for removal of foreign object, 
debridement, VAC
___:  To OR by Ortho trauma for debridement, VAC, patellar 
tendon repair
___:  To OR by Plastic surgery for L gastroc flap, debridement, 
STSG, VAC placement
___:  Superficial cellulitis LLE: Abx-Vanc, then  
Dicloxicillin.  Improved.  To complete 14d course abx.

Incremental increases in LLE dangling from bed daily.  Worked
