ECG ___ 
Normal sinus rhythm. Q wave in leads V1-V2. Diffuse ST-T wave 
changes in the standard leads and lateral precordial leads. 
Consider anteroseptal myocardial infarction No previous tracing 
available for comparison.  
.
CXR PA+Lateral ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Cardiomegaly without evidence for pulmonary edema. Small 
bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis. 
2. Bilateral glenohumeral degenerative changes, with deformity 
of the right humeral head which may relate to prior trauma. 
Correlate clinically, and consider dedicated radiographs of the 
right shoulder for further evaluation. 
.
TTE ___
Conclusions  
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___. There is moderate symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is borderline normal (LVEF = 
50-55%). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade 
III/IV (severe) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The 
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free 
wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending 
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling 
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with 
borderline normal systolic function and severe diastolic 
function (consider infiltrative disease such as amyloid).   

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
A+P: ___ woman with hx of CHF, HTN and breast cancer who 
presents with cough, dyspnea and bilateral pleural effusions.  
.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Heart Failure: Pt 
found to have bilateral pleural effusions on CXR.  Initial 
differential included ACS, PE, malignant pleural effusions but 
elevated BNP (4183), elevated JVD (to earlobe on admit), and 
clinical improvement with diuresis (O2 sats on ambulation 92-94% 
on discharge) most consistent with acute on chronic CHF.  Pt 
ruled out for ACS with plan for outpatient stress MIBI on 
___ (already scheduled).  ___ nl.  Echo showed EF now 50-55% 
but worsened diastolic heart failure with a question of 
infiltrative process (e.g. amyloid).  Could consider further 
work-up as an outpatient.  Pt discharged on lasix 80mg daily and 
home ___ for CHF monitoring and education; weight on discharge 
152.4 lbs.  Continued on beta blocker; ACE-I changed to ___ as 
below.  Pt to follow up with PCP ___ ___ should have 
Chemistries, BP, and fluid status checked at that time.  Pt will 
also follow up with her outpatient cardiologist, Dr. ___.
.
# Cough: Likely due to acute on chronic CHF, may also have 
component from ACE-I.  Lisinopril changed to Valsartan (80mg 
daily).  
.
# Acute renal failure: admitted with Cre of 1.2 which normalized 
to 0.8 with diuresis.
.
# HTN: increase in SBP to 140-150s once lisinopril discontinued. 
 Switched to valsartan, would increase HTN medications as 
tolerated. 
.
# Code status: Full.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, it was a pleasure participating in your care 
during your stay at the ___ (___).  You were admitted 
for cough and low oxygen levels and found to have fluid overload 
in your lungs (acute on chronic congestive heart failure) which 
may be due to stiffening of your heart, which was seen on your 
echocardiogram.  Your kidney function was also slightly worse in 
this setting. Both your fluid overload and your kidney function 
improved with removal of fluid (diuresis) via intravenous lasix 
(furosemide).  You will be discharged with an increase dose of 
your oral lasix and your lisinopril was discontinued and 
valsartan was chosen to replace it, as lisinopril may have 
contributed to your cough.  It will be important to maintain 
good blood pressure control (with your medications and a low 
salt diet) to prevent worsening of your heart function. 

The following changes were made to your medications:
- Increase Lasix (furosemide) from 10 mg orally daily to 80 mg 
orally daily
- Discontinue lisinopril
- Start Valsartan 80 mg orally daily

Weigh yourself daily, if you gain more than 3lb in one day, 
please call your primary care doctor.
 
Followup Instructions:
