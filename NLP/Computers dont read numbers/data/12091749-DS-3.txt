CXR ___

FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
There are
slightly low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular 
markings.
Given this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or 
pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are 
unremarkable. There are aortic calcifications.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes which accentuate the 
bronchovascular markings.
Given this, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with IDDM and AFib on coumadin who presents to 
ED from clinic after feeling nauseous, light headed, dizzy and 
found to have BG of 308.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS

1. High blood sugar: Patient with long history of diabetes and 
difficult to control BS. Urine was positive for ketones in ED 
with BG >300 and anion gap of 21. Patient had been feeling 
nauseated and did not eat or take her insulin on the morning of 
admission. She was given her home insulin dose of 44 units 70/30 
along with 2L NS in the ED. On the floor she was continued on 
home insulin of 42 units 70/30 in the evening along with HISS. 
BG morning of discharge was 158. K was trended and remained 
stable.

2. Elevated lactate: Lactate was 4.6 on admission. Etiology was 
thought to be combination of increased diarrhea, possible UTI, 
and dehydration due to elevated blood sugar. Patient was given 
2L normal saline in the ED and an additional liter overnight. 
Morning of discharge, lactate had trended down to 2.1 and 
patient felt at her baseline.

3. UTI: UA in the ED showed evidence of infection. She recieved 
1 dose of ceftriaxone in ED and was transitioned to bactrim DS 
bid on the floor. She was discharged to complete 5 days of 
treatment. Urine culture returned after discharge and showed 
likely fecal contamination.

4. AFib: Patient found to be in atrial fibrillation with good 
ventricular rate control. She was maintained on home dose of 
metoprolol tartrate for rate control. She is on coumadin 
prophylaxis and INR was noted to be 3.7 on admission. Coumadin 
was held and on day of discharge again noted to be high at 3.8. 
Patient was instructed to again hold her coumadin dose and was 
instructed to follow closely with her ___ clinic and PCP.

5. Foot ulcers: Appeared after sunburn 5 weeks ago. Blistered 
and developed into weeping ulcers on dorsum of feet bilaterally 
with edema and poorly demarcated erythema. Has been on 
amoxicillin bid during this time during which patient developed 
diarrhea. Ulcers were shallow and appeared to be healing well. 
Did not appear to be clinically infected and amoxicillin was 
discontinued. Patient was started on bactrim for 5 days as 
above.

6. Diarrhea: Appears to be side effect of amoxicillin. 
Considering lack of white count and nonmalignant course, there 
was low suspicion for CDiff. 

CHRONIC PROBLEMS

1. HTN: Patient was hypertensive on floor night of admission to 
170's SBP. She had not recieved home meds. She was given her 
home regimen of amlodipine 10, diovan 160, and metoprolol 
tartrate 50 bid. She was normotensive day of discharge.
