Chief Complaint:
Lower extremity weakness and incontinence 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is an ___ year old gentleman with a significant history 
of peripheral vascular disease including a AAA repair ___ years 
ago and a bilateral femoral endarterectomy ___ years ago, on 
plavix, who presents with acute onset of bilateral lower 
extremity numbness, weakness, and incontinence. He reports 
transient intermittent loss of motor and sentory function in his 
L leg for the past few months which has become more frequent in 
the last two weeks. Yesterday while standing at work he felt 
acute onset bilateral lower extremity numbness, tingling and 
weakness. All previous episodes were only in his left leg. He 
also noticed that he briefly lost continence of his bowels 
(without diarrhea). No urinary incontinence. He went home from 
work and called his physician who told him to come in for urgent 
evaluation. No further bowel incontinence since. [Please note 
that in the ED dashboard the call in says: ___ year old male 
cheif complaint of abd pain x 1month may have a pancreatic 
mass...??" however this appears to be for a different patient.]
.
On arrival in the ED his initial vital signs were 97.9 120/90 72 
18 100/ra. He was noted to have decreased reflexes in his left 
knee and decreased but present rectal tone. Vascular was 
consulted with concern for spinal cord compromise in the setting 
of a AAA repair. An MRI showed known disc disease at C5-C7 but 
no acute compromise of his spinal cord. Spine was notified (not 
formerly consulted) and said that given his imaging he could be 
admitted to medicine and followed by vascular and neurology. He 
received 2x 1mg IV dilaudid and 1.5 mg IV ativan as well as his 
evening coreg and gabapentin. Vital signs at the time of 
transfer were 97 63 100/ra 127/75.
.
On the floor he appeared a bit anxious and reporting significant 
lower back pain although he appeared relatively comfortable. He 
was ambulating up and down the halls with his IV. He reports no 
further episodes of incontinance and his lower extremity 
strength and numbness have resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ vasculopath s/p AAA repair presenting with acute onset 
bilateral ___ numbness and weakness along with bowel incontinence 
x1 that continued to have pain and paresthesia/numbness 
intermittently but patient ambulatory.
.
.
# Lower Extremity Weakness/Numbness + Incontinence: Presentation 
was initially very concerning for cord compression but there was 
no evidence of cord compression on MRI of C, T, L spine. These 
images were reviewed with the staff radiologist by the medical 
team in person. Vascular, neurosurgery, neurology were 
consulted. Vascular surgery felt this to be unlikely to be 
related to AAA repair. Neurosurgery felt the exam was 
non-localizing and that no spinal pathology appeared present and 
no surgical intervention was needed. Neurology performed LP 
given concern for viral or carcinomatous meningitis but studies 
were pending at time of discharge. They also raised the 
possibility of an inflammatory cauda equine. He was seen to be 
ambulating throughout admission though he reported continued 
pain and intermittent paresthesias and numbness in his buttock 
and lower extremities. His gabapentin was increased to Q8h 
dosing and he was treated prn with dilaudid IV. He was 
discharged on his home dose of vicodin. He underwent CTA of the 
iliac/femoral/lower ext which showed on preliminary read 
extensive plaque and circumferential clot seen throughout aorta 
extending through iliacs and branches throughout the legs, focal 
aneurysmal dilation of right external iliac up to 2.5 cm, SFA 
narrowed bilaterally with multiple areas of constriction, focal 
narrowing of the left popliteal but no obstruction and three 
vessel run-off present bilaterally. He should also have EMG and 
nerve conduction studies to evaluate for polyradiculopathy. 
.
# Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has an extensive 
history of atherosclerotic vasculopathy. He underwent AAA repair 
___ years ago, followed by Dr. ___. He was continued on 
aspirin and plavix and he was discharged on a nicotine patch. He 
was counselled on the importance of smoking cessation with his 
PVD.
.
# Carotid Artery Stenosis: Vascular surgery recommended carotid 
ultrasound which showed Right ICA stenosis <40%, Left ICA 
stenosis 70-79%. This result should be followed with either his 
existing vascular surgeon or Dr. ___ at ___ if patient 
desires. Plavix and aspirin were continued and nicotine patch 
was given.
.
# CAD: The patient has a history of MI in ___ with stent. He 
did not report any chest pain or shortness of breath or other 
signs or symptoms of ACS. He was put on rosuvastatin 10mg during 
admission as home dose was not known. He was discharged on this 
dose.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: His triglycerides were markedly elevated to 
441, total cholesterol 277, HDL 39, LDL 164. He was started on 
rosuvastatin 10mg as his home dose was unknown. 
.
# Primary Care: The patient was scheduled to follow up with 
___ MD at ___ on ___. 
-f/u CSF viral studies, cytology
-f/u final read CTA aorto-iliacs
-neurology f/u ___
-pt. should be scheduled for f/u with vascular surgery for f/u 
for carotid stenosis
-may need uptitration of rosuvastatin

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for symptoms of leg weakness, 
pain and numbness. You had an MRI of your spine which showed 
some disc buldging although no evidence of spinal cord 
compromise. You also had a lumbar puncture which was 
unrevealing. You also had a CT scan of your blood vessels which 
did not provide an explanation for your symptoms. You were 
evaluated by neurosurgery and vascular surgery who felt there 
was no need for surgery at this time. You were evaluated by 
neurology as well. 
.
Some of your medications were changed during this admission:
INCREASE gabapentin to 300mg by mouth every 8 hours
START nicotine patch daily
.
You should continue to take all of your other medications as 
prescribed.
