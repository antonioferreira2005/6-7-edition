Brief Hospital Course:
1. Legal: ___
2. Medical: Patient was transferred from medical service where 
she was initially admitted for monitoring of HD status following 
B-blocker/benzodiazepine overdose and self-inflicted superficial 
abrasions. Wound management recommended xeroform gauze to 
affected areas. Medical workup revealed up to 100K organisms of 
Klebsiella in her urine; 7-day course of ciprofloxaxin 250mg 
q24hr was initiated and completed on ___. Please see medical 
discharge summary for details on medical course. Other home 
medications were continued on psychiatric admission.

S/P RENAL/PANCREATIC TX: Mycophenolate and tacrolimus were 
continued at home doses. Patient is to follow-up with PCP and 
nephrologist on discharge. Renal transplant service followed 
daily and gave BP recs (increase amlodipine) and tacrolimus 
level (goal ___ monitoring. Tacrolimus was last checked on 
___ and found to be 6.

HTN: Metoprolol was continued and amlodipine was increased to 
7.5mg daily. SBP ranged from 120-160 during admission. 

ABNORMAL MOVEMENTS: Patient was noted to have occasional facial 
movements as well as  mild/fine postural and tremor bilaterally. 
Etiology was uncertain but tardive reaction from reglan, which 
the patient had taken continuously for ___ years, was suspected. 
Reglan was discontinued as it is not recommended for >12 weeks 
due to increased risk of movement disorders. 

S/P FALLS: Patient suffered multiple mechanical falls during 
psychiatric hospitalization. Falls were witnessed but patient 
reported hitting her head. CT head and neck was negative for 
acute bleed or fracture. Neurology was consulted and felt that 
her gait instability was multifactorial (peripheral neuropathy 
___ DM1, cervical stenosis, polypharmacy). Fall precautions was 
instituted. B12, folate, RPR wnl. Repeated falls contributed to 
decision to transfer patient to medical service for closer 
monitoring in the setting of polypharmacy and cognitive 
deficits.

HYPONATREMIA: Sodium nadir was 127 from a normal baseline. 
Differential included pain-induced SIADH vs. increased free 
water intake in the hospital. Patient was started on a 1L water 
restricted diet with minimal improvement of hyponatremia. Renal 
transplant consultants recommended considering transfer to 
medical service for further management and monitoring of 
hyponatremia given complicated medical history.

3. Psychiatric:
#) DEPRESSION: Patient was initially transferred from ___ 
___ after intentional OD on metoprolol (25mg x20) and 
lorazepam 6mg as SA in the setting of feeling overwhelmed with 
upcoming holidays. She was admitted to medicine for monitoring 
of HD status in light of significant B-blocker/BZD combination 
overdose. She remained HD stable on medicine and was followed by 
psychiatry consultation service who felt that the patient needed 
to be admitted to psychiatry for ongoing risk assessment as well 
as medication readjustment. Home citalopram and buproprion were 
continued to target underlying NVG symptoms. Methylphenidate was 
discontinued as it was felt to be contributing to patient's new 
onset tremor and increased lewd verbal content (per husband). 
Throughout psychiatric admission, patient denied depressive 
symptoms and thoughts of self-harm. She continued to show poor 
insight into the gravity of her attempt leading to admission, 
likely due to her baseline cognitive limitations in conjunction 
with confusional state and disinhibition associated with UTI at 
the time of overdose. Patient was able to cite her loving 
husband, friends, and children as protective factors and was 
able to engage in safety planning by stating that she would let 
her husband know if she was feeling suicidal or depressed in the 
future. On discharge from Deac 4, the patient denied NVG 
symptoms, was more future-oriented, in good behavioral control, 
and at her cognitive baseline. 

Collateral Information:
#) OUTPT TEAM - Patients outpatient Psychiatrist, Dr. ___ 
PCP, ___ contacted at time of admission in order to 
discuss circumstances of patients hospitalization and to obtain 
relevant history. Dr. ___ that the patient had initially 
presented to his office with depression and SI but had reported 
remission of symptoms after starting citalopram and buproprion. 
Recently, he had increased her methylphenidate dose to target 
residual anergia. Dr. ___ discontinuing 
methylphenidate and starting modafinil to address persistent 
anergia. Follow-up appointments were arranged with PCP and 
psychiatrist on discharge.

#) HOSPITAL RECORDS  ___ records were reviewed.

4. Social/Milieu:
#) GROUPS - Patient attended very few groups due to neck pain, 
ongoing headaches, anergia, and cognitive limitations.

#) FAMILY  SW remained in contact with husband during 
hospitalization. Discussions were focused on psychoeducation and 
disposition planning. Husband remained supportive of the patient 
and was in agreement with treatment plan. Husband noted that the 
patient had not been particularly depressed prior to her 
overdose and that it was unexpected. He believes that her 
decision to act on her impulse to self-harm was influenced her 
confusion associated with UTI. He feels that the patient would 
be safe following discharge back to home. Husband admits to some 
degree of difficulty in managing the patient's daily needs but 
did not feel strongly about looking into services offered by 
social worker.

5. Risk Assessment:
The patient represents a chronic risk of impulsive and 
potentially dangerous behaviors given chronic medical illness, 
recent impulsive SA, history of brain injury, and disability 
status. Modifiable risk factors addressed during hospitalization 
include the following: recent life stressors (supportive 
therapy), depression (above-noted medication adjustments), 
access to suicidal means  (restricted to unit), anxiety (ativan 
PRN) and maladaptive coping skills (group therapy). Protective 
factors include that the patient is currently in good behavioral 
control, denying suicidal ideation, not abusing substances, 
medication compliant, future-oriented, and connected with 
outpatient treatment. 

6. DISPOSITION: Patient was transferred to medicine for ongoing 
management of hyponatremia and frequent falls. Inpatient team 
does not feel that the patient would benefit from psychiatric 
re-hospitalization as her depression has been stablized. 
However, if the primary medical team has concerns regarding her 
acute safety or psychiatric medications, psychiatry CL service 
should be consulted. Follow-up appointments with outpatient 
psychiatrist and PCP were arranged. We recommend that her 
psychiatric medications be continued at the doses on discharge 
from inpatient psychiatry.
