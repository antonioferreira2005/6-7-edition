STUDIES
___ RENAL US
IMPRESSION: 
NONOBSTRUCTING RIGHT KIDNEY STONES. OTHERWISE UNREMARKABLE. NO 
HYDRONEPHROSIS.
 
___: IMMUNOPHENOTYPING-PB
INTERPRETATION
Immunophenotypic findings show a T cell dominant profile with an 
expanded population of CD8(+)CD57(+) T cells.
Review of peripheral smear shows 63% large granular lymphocytes 
(LGLs); based on absolute lymph count on concurrent CBC of 
16,195 per uL, calculated absolute LGL count is 10,203 per uL.
The differential diagnosis includes a neoplastic versus reactive 
LGL pproliferation, therefore the sample will be sent for 
molecular analysis for further characterization and the results 
reported separately.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of HCV cirrhosis c/b ___ s/p OLT ___ who was 
sent in from clinic after she was noted to have new ___ on 
outpatient labs. Patient was transfused 2 L of NS and her 
creatinine trended down from 1.9 --> 1.1 in 24 hrs. She was 
instructed to take daily weight and call her doctor if her 
weights changed by more than 3lbs in either direction. 
Leukocytosis is stable and she will follow up with hematology as 
outpatient. Pt will follow up in transplant clinic, PCP, 
___ and Cardiology. 

ACUTE ISSUES

# Acute Kidney injury - DDx includes prerenal from dehydration, 
and appears responsive to IVF. No evidence of obstruction. 
Continued IVF overnight and considered evaluation for other 
causes (vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, etc.) in the AM if not 
improved. Cr improved to 1.1 at time of discharge. Restarted 
Lasix at discharge and held lisinopril. Instructed patient to 
weigh herself every day and call her doctor if she loses or 
gains over 3 lbs. 

# Post liver transplant: continue tacrolimus with a goal trough 
of ___ for now. Patient will follow up in Transplant Clinic 
after discharge from the hospital. 

CHRONIC ISSUES

# Leukocytosis: predominantly lymphocytes. The concern for PTLD 
with CLL phenotype was raised. EBV and CMV viral load negative, 
and CT-chest, abdomen, pelvis without lymphadenopathy or 
lesions. Will await the opinion of patient's outpatient 
hematologist.  

# Hepatitis C: Last viral load negative. Outpatient followup. 
 
# Aortic stenosis: ___ 0.9. Stable and asymptomatic. Follow with 
annual ECHO  
- continue metoprolol 25mg BID  

# Rosacea - Written for topical treatment by dermatology. Have 
not yet written her home topical meds, pending final derm note 
from visit.  

# HTN: Held lisinopril and lasix given ___. Restarted Lasix at 
discharge. 
  
# ANXIETY/DEPRESSION: Cont home ativan and citalopram  

# GERD: home famotidine PRN  

# INSOMNIA: continue home ambien with caution. Reduced her dose 
from 10mg to 5mg  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
-pt will have creatinine drawn on ___ (ordered by 
hematologist)
-pt instructed to do daily weights and notify phyisician if 
weight changes in either direction by >3lbs
-pt will continue on Lasix since she has severe aortic stenosis 
and is at high risk of fluid overload; pt will need follow up 
with cardiologist regarding her severe AS
-we stopped the patients Lisinopril. She should hold the 
lisinopril until she sees her transplant attending and pending 
her creatinine level on ___
-pt has blood pressure cuff at home; instructed to take her 
blood pressure daily; If systolic blood pressure ___ number) is 
greater than 160 she was instructed to call the transplant 
clinic to send a message to Dr. ___.
