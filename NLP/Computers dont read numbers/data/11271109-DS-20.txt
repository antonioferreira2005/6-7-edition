History of Present Illness:
Ms ___ is an ___ F h/o afib who first presented at OSH 
for acute confusion. This morning, the patient's neighbor went 
upstairs to wish her Merry Christmas and found her on the couch, 
altered and not responding appropriately. EMS was called and 
they noted the patient to be bradycardic to 26 bpm and 
hypotensive to SBP 50-60s on arrival. She was transported to 
___, where she was given peripheral levophed, dopamine at 20 
mcg/kg/min and glucagon. There was no apparent benefit from the 
glucagon. Labs were notable for leukocytosis to 15.4, Cr 
2(unknown baseline), INR 2.4, lactate 5.7. CT of the head was 
obtained in the setting of AMS, which was negative per report. 
Per report, mental status improved with VS. ECG from the outside 
hospital was notable for slow atrial flutter, per report. 

In the ED, initial vitals were: T96.0, HR84, BP105/68, RR17, 90% 
2L NC on dopamine 15 and levophed 0.2
Exam notable for: AAOx3. RRR, systolic ejection murmur at RUSB, 
JVP ~8 cm H2O, abdomen soft nontender, nondistended, no 
peripheral edema.
Patient adamantly refusing any non-compliance with her beta 
blocker. States she uses a pill box and thus has not taken any 
extra dose.

Moderate  cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is central pulmonary 
vascular congestion with only trace interstitial edema. 
Otherwise no consolidation is seen. There is no large effusion 
or pneumothorax. 
Patient was given: 
IV DRIP DOPamine 15 mcg/kg/min 
IV DRIP NORepinephrine 0.24 mcg/kg/min 
IV Vancomycin (1000 mg ordered)
Cardiology was consulted and recommended admission to the CCU.
Vitals on transfer: T97.4, HR112, BP110/81, RR19, 96% RA 

On arrival to the CCU, patient reports no ongoing symptoms, 
including no chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, 
dizziness, nausea, diaphoresis, presyncope. She confirms the 
above story and states that this morning she felt dizzy, 
diaphoretic and weak all of a sudden. She denies any fevers, 
chills, cough, colds, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, rashes, dysuria 
or other symptoms prior to this morning. She reports compliance 
with her medications.

STUDIES/IMAGING
===============
___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
Compared to prior examination, there is an placement of a right 
IJ central 
venous catheter terminating in the mid SVC, satisfactory.  
Moderate 
cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is central pulmonary vascular 
congestion 
with only trace interstitial edema.  Otherwise no consolidation 
is seen.  
There is no large effusion or pneumothorax. 

___ Cardiovascular ECHO 
 The left atrial volume index is severely increased. Mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, 
and regional/global systolic function (3D LVEF = 59%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is 
very severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.5 cm2). Mild 
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean 
gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
 IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with normal global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. Very severe aortic stenosis. 
Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. 
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary 
hypertension.  

___ Cardiovascular EP Procedure Report 
 Successful implantation of a dual chamber pacemaker.
 There were no complications.

___ Imaging CHEST (PA & LAT) 
Hyperinflation is probably due to emphysema.  Moderate 
cardiomegaly, with 
particular left atrial enlargement has improved.  Transvenous 
right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads continuous from 
the left pectoral generator unchanged in their positions.  There 
is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.  
Given the simultaneous onset of heterogeneous opacification more 
pronounced in the right lung on ___, I think it all is 
attributable to heart failure and pulmonary edema.  Subsequently 
the multifocal abnormality in the right lung has substantially 
improved, and small to moderate pleural effusions are stable, 
but there is now the suggestion of new consolidation at the left 
lung base, more concerning for pneumonia.  There is no 
pneumothorax.  
Indwelling right jugular line ends in the mid to low SVC. 

___ Imaging CTA ABD & PELVIS 
1. Bilateral femoral, external iliac, and common iliac arteries 
are patent and without significant calcium burden or tortuosity. 

2. 11 mm left adrenal nodule is not fully characterized on this 
study, but 
statistically likely represents an adenoma. 
3. Pericholecystic fluid, periportal edema, bilateral pleural 
effusions and subcutaneous edema suggestive of fluid overload. 
4. Please refer to the separate report of CT chest performed on 
the same day for description of the thoracic findings. 

___ Imaging CARDIAC STRUCTURE/MORPH 
1. Aortic valve stenosis without evidence of aortic aneurysm. 
2. Patent subclavian and common femoral arteries bilaterally 
with lumen 
diameter greater than 6 mm. 
3. Pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are suggestive of volume 
overload/pulmonary edema. 
4. Small to moderate bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions. 

5. Extensive coronary arterial calcifications. 
6. Please see separately submitted report of CTA abdomen and 
pelvis from the same date for findings below the diaphragm. 

___ Imaging UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US  
Short segment partially occlusive clot within the cephalic vein 
as it crosses the antecubital fossa.  No evidence of DVT. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
==============
Ms. ___ is an ___ with a history of HTN, HLD, afib 
here w/ symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension, found to have 
complete heart block, s/p permanent pacemaker placement on 
___, noted to have severe AS on ECHO completed while 
inpatient.

ACUTE ISSUES :
================
# Complete heart block
# Symptomatic bradycardia
# Atrial fibrillation
Patient presented with acute onset symptomatic bradycardia with 
dizziness, hypotension, diaphoresis. She was noted to have 
complete heart block on ECG on a background of atrial flutter/ 
fibrillation, prompting CCU admission. She was supported with 
pressors until a dual chamber pacemaker was placed (___). 
Etiology remains unclear; possible nodal agent overdose (pt 
denies) vs infection (leukocytosis on admission, but infectious 
w/u negative), vs hypothyroidism (TSH elevated at 5.5). After 
pacemaker placement, patient was restarted on Metoprolol 
Succinate XL at an increase dose of 200 mg daily and her home 
Diltiazem ER dose was increased to 240 mg daily. Physical 
therapy recommended discharge to home with home ___.

# Shock
On presentation, patient was hypotensive to ___ systolic iso 
bradycardia and complete heart block. Infectious workup was 
negative, no focal exam findings. Lactate was initially elevated 
to 5.4, improved with IVF, and she was weaned off pressors. TTE 
with symmetric LVH, severe AS, but with normal global and 
regional biventricular systolic function.

# ___
Creatinine elevated at 1.6 on admission, likely hypovolemic iso 
bradycardia from complete heart block. ___ now resolved with 
fluids and placement of pacemaker. Creatinine on day of 
discharge 0.5.

# Severe Aortic Stenosis
Patient asymptomatic, but noted to have severe AS on ECHO ___. 
Per ECHO, "Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. 
Very severe AS, Mild (1+)AR." While inpatient she was evaluated 
by the cardiac surgery team and deemed to be a high risk 
surgical candidate. Patient will undergo outpatient TAVR workup.

# Atrial fibrillation
CHADS2VASC minimum 5 (age, female, HTN, CHF). Home meds are 
coumadin, diltiazem and metoprolol. Patient's home Coumadin was 
initially held and was restarted after pacemaker placement at 
3mg daily, with goal INR ___. Metoprolol and diltiazem were 
initially held given hypotension, and restarted prior to 
discharge at Metoprolol Succinate XL 200 mg daily and Diltiazem 
ER 240mg daily.

# UTI: 
Urine culture grew pan sensitive E. Coli infection. Started on 
Cefepime, transitioned to Macrobid for a total 7 day course, 
which will end ___.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
=================
# Hypertension: 
Anti-hypertensive medications nitially held in the setting of 
hypotension, discharged on Metoprolol Succinate XL 200 mg. 
Diltiazem ER was increased to 240mg daily.

# Dementia: Continued donepezil and memantine.

# HLD: Continued home pravastatin.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
[] Aortic Stenosis:
Patient will be evaluated by structural heart team as outpatient 
for further TAVR work up.
[] Nortriptyline:
Discuss alternative medication, Nortriptyline was held given 
potential cardiac interaction.
