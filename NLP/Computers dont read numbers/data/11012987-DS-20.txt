Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE

___ F with history of HTN, PCKD s/p kidney tx ___ for polycystic 
kidney disease, osteoporosis, admission ___ year ago for E.coli 
UTI here and recent admit in ___ for same now presents with 
feeling unwell and Cr of 1.6 and hyponatremia to 124. Urine 
lytes, relative hypotension and weight loss were consistent with 
a pre-renal etiology, likely from decreased PO intake. Urine 
osmolality also decreased as patient was rehydrated, so etiology 
of hyponatremia was thought to be at least partially 
hypovolemic. Creatinine and sodium recovered with hydration, 
although sodium remained 127 on day of discharge. Pt spiked to 
102 on ___ associated with back pain. She was initially started 
on cipro for UTI but transitioned to cefpodoxime when 
sensitivities were obtained from OSH. Day one of cefpodoxime was 
___ to continue for ___CTIVE ISSUES
# UTI: On ___ developed back pain and fever to 102. Given 
similar quality to previous episodes of UTI  this was considered 
likely to be incomplete treatment of a previous UTI at ___. 
OSH records were obtained showing organism that was resistant to 
cipro so she was started on cefpodoxime for ___: On admission FeNa <1%, patient's baseline BP lower and 
per patient decreased UO over few days so etiology ___ likely 
prerenal likely from fluid restriction at OSH. However, given 
previous improvment of Na with fluid restriction in ___ were 
wary of SIADH complicating hydration. Continued to have 
improvmeent in creatinine and sodium with hydration. On 
discharge creatinine 1.4.

# Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia given poor urine 
output and lower blood pressure. However, on admission urine 
osmolality was 418 and Na had recovered in ___ with fluid 
restriction, so possible component of euvolemic HoNa from ___. 
However in prescence of vague malaise and anorexia (which is 
likely from HoNa itself) did r/o hypocortisolism or thyroid 
disease. Sodium inconsistently recovered and at discharge was 
127.

INACTIVE ISSUES
# Renal Tx: Recieved in ___ for PCKD.  No current pain over 
site of graft. No signs of intrinsic renal dysfunction to 
suggest rejection so continue current immunosuppression.
# Anemia: HgB 9.4 currently. Unclear etiology, but last got EPO 
a few months ago. Possibly from CKD despite transplant. Continue 
home iron. 
# Osteoporosis: cont VitD/calcium at home dose

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care.  You were admitted 
because the sodium level in your blood was low.  We found that 
you were dehydrated and likely had an incompletely treated 
urinary tract infection.  Your sodium is gradually improving, 
although it continues to remain low.  We feel that it will 
gradually improve with time, but be sure to follow up with your 
nephrologist.
 
Followup Instructions:
