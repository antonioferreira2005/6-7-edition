Imaging: 

___: MR ___:
1. Marrow edema and fracture line involving the lateral tibial 
plateau, with a small amount of fat seen within the joint 
(lipohemarthrosis).  The appearance is compatible with a 
nondisplaced fracture of the lateral proximal tibia/tibial 
plateau.  (Mild depression of the tibial plateau articular 
surface may be present).  Although no obvious cortical 
interruption is identified, a subtle defect a subtle occult 
cortical defect is likely present. If clinically indicated, CT 
could help to more completely assess cortical integrity. 
2. Small focus of bone contusion in the proximal fibula. 
3. High-grade injury to the proximal portion of the tibial 
collateral ligament (i.e. superficial fibers of the medial 
collateral ligament).  This likely represents a complete 
tear/grade 3 sprain.  A very high-grade grade 2 sprain is 
considered much less likely.  The abnormality extends into the 
adjoining posterior fibers of the medial patellar retinaculum.  
There is likely also mild sprain of the 
superficial/meniscofemoral fibers of the deep MCL. 
4. Extensive interstitial, subcutaneous, and intramuscular 
edema, detailed 
above. 
5. Cruciate and lateral collateral ligaments are intact. 
6. No medial or lateral meniscal tear is detected. 

___: Left ___ and Femur:
No fracture.  Curvilinear 1.6 cm radiopaque foreign body 
potentially within the subcutaneous soft tissues of the thigh.

___: ___ foot x-ray (AP&lateral):
No fracture. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old male who presented to ___ on 
___ s/p pedestrian struck by motor vehicle.  He had imaging 
in the ED which was negative for injury, but was admitted to the 
Trauma service for pain control and to assess mobility. 

While ambulating, the patient endorsed ___ pain which 
warranted an MRI.  The MRI revealed a ___ tibial plateau 
fracture and the Orthopaedics team was consulted. On HD4, the 
patient received ___ brace and was instructed to remain 
weight-bearing as tolerated. Physical Therapy worked with the 
patient and recommended his discharge to home with outpatient 
Physical Therapy.  Prescriptions for a rolling walker and 
outpatient physical therapy were provided.  

The remainder of the ___ hospital course is summarized by 
systems below:

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; once tolerating a diet, he was started on oral 
pain medication. 

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 

GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO with a 
___ tube in place for decompression.  The diet was 
advanced sequentially to a Regular diet, which was well 
tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored

ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none.

HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan. Follow-up appointments were 
made with the ___ clinic and his primary care provider.
