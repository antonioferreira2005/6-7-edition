Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
Stable WBC count

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with IV antibiotics 
followed by a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The 
surgical dressing was changed on POD#1 and the surgical incision 
was found to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal 
drainage. A custom OT thumb spica splint was made for the 
patient. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and 
repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was 
tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was 
afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was 
acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on an oral 
regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly intact and 
the wound was benign. 

The patient was seen by Infectious Disease prior to discharge 
who recommended that the patient be placed on Vancomycin and 
Ceftriaxone, however, the patient was not willing to wait for a 
PICC line and teaching, and therefore the ID service compromised 
and recommended the patient be discharged on Bactrim DS 2 tabs 
PO BID, with plan for follow-up placement of PICC line in 
outpatient hand clinic, and weekly monitoring of CBC/diff, Chem 
7, LFTs, CRP/ESR with results faxed to Dr. ___ at
