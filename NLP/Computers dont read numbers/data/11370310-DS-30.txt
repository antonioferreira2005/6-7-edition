Chief Complaint:
1. Left lower extremity critical limb ischemia
2. L ___ toe infection
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

___ Left ___ toe amputation

 
History of Present Illness:
This ___ year old woman with Diabetes Type I has an extensive
history of PVD that includes left and right bypass surgeries, as
well as multiple percutaneous procedures to both legs and a
bypass revision to the right leg and ultimately a right below 
the
knee amputation in ___. She subsequently had an infection
in the BKA stump and had multiple debridements done in ___. She also had difficulty with her first prosthesis because
it did not fit correctly. She recently got a new right lower
extremity prosthesis and has been doing more walking.  Last 
week,
she discovered a new ulcer to her left fourth and fifth toes. 
She
denies any left lower extremity claudicatoin symptoms. She was
seen by Dr. ___ in the office on ___. She had a left
lower extremity arterial duplex which revealed a patent left
fem/pop bypass without stenosis. There was dampening at the
metatarsal level consistent with tibial outflow disease.
Given the patients history of right BKA, she is extremely
concerned about the ulcer on her left leg. She has been referred
now for left lower extremity angiography to confirm that she has
adequate blood flow to heal the ulceration on her left foot. 

Of note, she reports a small open area, approximately ½ inch 
wide
to her right bka incision site from her initial prosthesis that
was not fitting correctly. This has not healed over the past
several weeks. 

From a cardiac standpoint, she denies any chest pain or dyspnea.

Pertinent Results:
___ 09:49AM   GLUCOSE-291* K+-5.1
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted through Same Day Surgery and was taken 
to the Angiography suite where she underwent a diagnostic 
angiogram with LLE run-off and a left ___ toe amputation. She 
tolerated the procedure well and after being monitored for a 
brief period in the PACU, was transferred to the floor. On 
postoperative day #1 she was advanced to a regular diabetic diet 
and her pain medication was changed to the oral form. She was 
evaluated by Physical Therapy and it was determined that she 
would be safe to be discharged to home with LLE partial weight 
bearing and a healing ___ to be worn while she ambulates. 
Intraoperative cultures grew Gram positive cocci and rods, as 
well as Gram negative rods. She was started on a 10 day oral 
course of Bactrim and Ciprofloxacin on postoperative day #2. It 
was also noted on postoperative day #2 that the patient was able 
to perform adequate transfers with partial LLE weight bearing, 
her pain was adequately controlled with oral pain medication, 
and she was tolerating a regular diet. She was therefore 
discharged to home on ___ with ___ and directions to follow
