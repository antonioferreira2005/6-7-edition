Warfarin (Coumadin):
What is this medicine used for?
This medicine is used to thin the blood so that clots will not 
form.
How does it work?
Warfarin changes the body's clotting system.  It thins the blood 
to prevent clots from forming.
What you should contact your healthcare provider ___:
Signs of a life-threatening reaction. These include wheezing; 
chest tightness; fever; itching; bad cough; blue skin color; 
fits; or swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat, severe 
dizziness or passing out, falls or accidents, especially if you 
hit your head. Talk with healthcare provider even if you feel 
fine, significant change in thinking clearly and logically, 
severe headache, severe back pain, severe belly pain, black, 
tarry, or bloody stools, blood in the urine, nosebleeds, 
coughing up blood, vomiting blood, unusual bruising or bleeding, 
severe menstrual bleedin, or rash.
Call your doctor if you are unable to eat for several days, for 
whatever reason. Also call if you have stomach problems, 
vomiting, or diarrhea that lasts more than 1 day. These problems 
could affect your Coumadin/warfarin dosage.
Coumadin (Warfarin) and diet:
Certain foods and beverages can impair the effect of warfarin. 
For this reason, it's important to pay attention to what you eat 
while taking this medication. 
Until recently, doctors advised ___ taking warfarin to avoid 
foods high in vitamin K. This is because large amounts of 
vitamin K can counteract the benefits of warfarin. However, 
recent research shows that rather than eliminating vitamin K 
from your diet, it is more important to be consistent in your 
dietary vitamin K intake.
 
These foods contain vitamin K:
Fruits and vegetables, such as: Kiwi, Blueberries, Broccoli, 
Cabbage, ___ sprouts, Green onions, Asparagus, Cauliflower, 
Peas, Lettuce, Spinach, Turnip, ___, and mustard greens, 
Parsley, Kale, Endive. Meats, such as: Beef liver, Pork liver. 
Other: ___, Margarine, Canola oil, Soybean oil, Vitamins, 
Soybeans and Cashews.
Limit alcohol. Alcohol can affect your ___ dosage 
but it does not mean you must avoid all alcohol. Serious 
problems can occur with alcohol and ___ when you 
drink more than 2 drinks a day or when you change your usual 
pattern. Binge drinking is not good for you. Be careful on 
special occasions or holidays, and drink only what you usually 
would on any regular day of the week.
Monitoring:
The doctor decides how much ___ you need by 
testing your blood. The test measures how fast your blood is 
clotting and lets the doctor know if your dosage should change. 
If your blood test is too high, you might be at risk for 
bleeding problems. If it is too low, you might be at risk for 
forming clots. Your doctor has decided on a range on the blood 
test that is right for you. The blood test used for monitoring 
is called an INR.
Use of Other medications: 
When Coumadin/warfarin is taken with other medicines it can 
change the way other medicines work. Other medicines can also 
change the way ___ works. It is very important to 
talk with your doctor about all of the other medicines that you 
are taking, including over-the-counter medicines, antibiotics, 
vitamins, or herbal products.
