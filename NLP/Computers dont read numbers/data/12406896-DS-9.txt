CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: 
1. Right lower lobe segmental and subsegmental pulmonary embolus 
without 
complication such as secondary right heart strain or pulmonary 
infarcts. 
.  
2. Unchanged 2-mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule. A 3-mm 
right upper 
lobe pulmonary nodule was not definitely visualized and could be 
embedded in atelectasis from the prior study. 
.
Lower Extremity Ultrasound:  Deep vein thrombosis of the left 
lower extremity involving the common femoral through popliteal 
veins. No right DVT and the normal respiratory variability in 
flow on the right suggests no IVC clot. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
# DVT/Pulmonary Embolism:  The patinet was found to have a DVT, 
as well as a segmental pulmonary embolism.  She was 
hemodynamically stable, without tachycardia, tachypnea, or 
hypoxia.  Her left leg was swollen, but with dopplerable pulses, 
was non tense, non painful.  She was started on lovenox as a 
bridge to coumadin, with a goal INR of ___.  While her 
anticoagulation should continue for at least 9 months, given 
that the inciting event of immobility cannot be reversed, and 
that this occured while on prophylactic fragmin, we would 
continue the coumadin indefinatly.  She is planned to have her 
INR checked by her ___ 2 days from discharge, with manegment to 
be continued by her PCP.  Plan was communicated to PCP.
.
# Diabetes:  The patinet was started on insulin while on a 
prednisone taper, which is now complete.  She had not additional 
insulin requirments during the hospitalization and her 
hemoglobin A1C is still pending.  We have reduced her NPH doses 
in half, to 18units each morning, 5 units at night.  Her finger 
sticks should be watched closely, with consideration of 
eliminating insulin versus increasing back to pre-hospitalzation 
levels.  We have deffered starting aspirin unitl insue resolved.
.
# Neuromyeltis Optica:  Had recent flare in early ___, treated 
with IV steroids with 2 week taper as well as Rituximab. At 
baseline patient is unable to move ___ since last admission. No 
evidence of current current fare.  Continued Baclofen.
.
# HBV: continue lamivudine.

Discharge Instructions:
You are being discharged from the hospital after an admission 
for swelling of your left leg.  You were found to have a clot in 
both your leg and in your lung.  You have been started on a 
blood thinner to help prevent these clots from getting larger.  
One blood thinner is know as coumadin, which you will take 
daily.  We measure the level of this medication looking at a 
number called INR, which we want to see between 2 to 3.  You 
will have regular blood checks to make sure level is good, and 
you dose may need to be adjusted.  Tell any physican prescribing 
you new medication that you take coumadin, as new medications 
can interact with coumadin.
  We are also starting you on an injectable medicine known as 
lovenox.  You will take this medicine until your coumadin dosing 
is therapeutic.
  If you develop any worsening leg swelling, increasing leg 
pain, a cold leg or change in color, or any other concerning 
symptoms, you should go to the emergency room.  If you develop 
any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, you should 
call your PCP or go to the emergency room.
.
  You have been on insulin since being on steroids, which you 
may no longer need now that you have comleted your prednisone 
taper.  We have cut the doses of your NPH in half, and your 
primery care physican should help assess if the NPH can be 
stopped all together.
