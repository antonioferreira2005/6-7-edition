Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was placed on LTM, her EEG was active with spikes. 
She did not have any seizures.
We slowly decreased her lamictal while starting her on keppra.
She was off the lamictal on ___. She reached 750mg of 
keppra on ___ but was ataxic, and we therefore lowered the 
dose to 500mg BID.
She reported feeing "funny" on the keppra, which is not 
unexpected. Lowering the dose will help with the side effects. 
Of note, her spikes decreased after she was started on the
