CXR ___: As compared to the previous examination, there is a 
newly occurred extensive right-sided pleural effusion. The 
effusion occupies more than half of the right hemithorax. The 
effusion causes atelectasis of the right lung parenchyma and 
deviation of the mediastinum to the left.

effusion distributes in a slightly different manner. The overall 
extent of 
effusion; however, does not appear to have substantially 
changed.

CXR ___: Right-sided effusion, with obscuration of the

successfully cleared her pleural effusion.  CXR ___ documented 
resolution of hydrothorax.
.
Urine Na/K ratio of 0.3 on admission with spot urine Na of 17 
indicates inadequate diuresis on home regimen, with or without 
dietary compliance.  The patient's description of her diet 
sounds as though it would be noncompliant but she states that it 
is low sodium in content.

Patient received thoracentesis (~1.5 L removed) with resultant 
symptomatic relief.  Diuretics regimen was uptirated to lasix 40 
mg qday, aldactone 100 mg qAM, 50 mg qPM, tolvaptan 15 mg po 
qday; she tolerated this well with stable Na (133-135, 129 on 
admission) and no elevation in creatinine.  Repeat CXR ___, 
___ showed mild improvement but no resolution of hydrothorax.  
Given ongoing continued diuresis and relief of all shortness of
