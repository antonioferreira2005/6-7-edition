Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: ___ yr old with ETOH cirrhosis, chronic 
pancreatitis with nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain and ETOH 
intoxication.  
.  
# N/V/abdominal pain: Unclear etiology.  Patient reports that 
the pain is different from her chronic abdominal pain but cannot 
explain how.  She is diffusly tender to light palpation all over 
her chest and abdomen.  She frequently requested IV narcotics.  
A recent EGD showed grade 1 esophogeal varicies, ulcers in the 
duodenal bulb and congestive gastropathy.  Her pain may have 
been related to these findings.  She had recently been admitted 
and seen by the pain service who recommedned that narcotics not 
be used in her case, but that a fentanyl patch be used if 
needed.  She was unable to tolerate a fentanyl patch secondary 
to an allergy.  Narcotics were avoided in this patient given her 
ongoing alchohol problem.  She was not given narcotics and 
became very agitated, threw her lunch tray across the room and 
signed out against medical advice.    
.  
# ?upper GI bleed: As per ED there was a question of coffee 
ground emesis, however a gastroccult was negative. Per her 
recent EGD, she has reasons to have hematemesis, however this 
pesentation was not consistent with a variceal bleed. 
.  
# ETOH/cirrhosis: patient presented to the ED intoxicated. She 
has a history of DT's.  Cirrhosis was again confirmed on 
ultrasound of RUQ.  It was suspected by the nursing staff that 
she was drinking vodka in the bathroom as she made frequent 
trips and her breath consistently smelled of vodka despite being 
in the hospital overnight, however this was not confirmed.  Her 
CIWA scores were not elevated and she was not given any 
benzodiazepines (except for some that she recieved in the ED).  
She was given two banana bags and instructed to start oral 
thiamine and folate.  Social work did not have an opportunity to 
meet with her.    
.  
# PPx: pneumoboots, IV PPI  
.  
# Code: FULL  
.  
# Dispo: Patient left against medical advice.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ for nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, 
and a question of blood in your vomit.  A test for blood in your 
vomit was negative.  However, you likely have ongoing gastritis 
in your stomach which could cause further bleeding.  This is 
especially true in the setting of alcohol.  You should seek 
treatment for your alcoholism so that you can be monitored 
safely in a safe environment.  

You are at risk for alcohol withdrawal, which can be complicated 
by seizure or even death.  This was explained to you, but you 
chose to leave against medical advice.  It was explained that we 
did not feel your pain is best treated with narcotics, and other 
options were offered including ultram or a pain management 
consult for more options.  Despite these offers and an 
explaination of your risk for leaving, you chose to leave AMA.
 
Followup Instructions:
