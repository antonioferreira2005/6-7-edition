History of Present Illness:
Patient is a ___ with history of EtOH cirrhosis (Child's C, 
MELD-Na 19, prior decompensation with ascites/HE/varices), 
dilated cardiomyopathy (EtOH related)/HFpEF (LVEF LVEF=55-60% 
___, recurrent epistaxis, and small intracranial hemorrhages 
who presents with findings of hyperkalemia and ___ on outpatient 
labs.  

Of note, patient was just recently hospitalized at ___ 
___ iso decreased Hb found on routine 
outpatient labs.  He was also incidentally found to have SBP.  
Hb was 6.6 on admission, downtrended to 6.0 despite transfusion. 
 No concern for GIB, he was having recurrent epistaxis ___. 

Hemolysis labs difficult to interpret in the setting of 
cirrhosis and transfusion, although LDH never significantly 
elevated.  Patient was managed with PPI and Carafate.  He did 
undergo EGD, which showed post-banding ulceration in the distal 
esophagus (s/p banding in late ___ and portal HTN 
gastropathy, no intervention was performed.  No RP bleed on CT 
A/P WO contrast, though there were several hyperdense foci 
within the right lower quadrant, likely within the lumen of the 
cecum, suspicious for GI bleeding.  Colonoscopy subsequently did 
not reveal any active bleeding, though there were
angioectasias (descending/sigmoid colon), varices (ascending 
colon, retum).  Patient was ultimately transfused 6U PRBCs, Hb 
7.0 at time of discharge.  Hospital course was otherwise notable 
for SBP on diagnostic paracentesis, patient completed a 5-day 
course of CTX, discharged on ppx ciprofloxacin.  He was also 
thought to be volume overloaded with known HFrEF, underwent 
diuresis with furosemide 40mg IV as needed.  

Patient was evaluated by Dr. ___ ___, noted to have 
increasing ascites and edema (plan to increase furosemide and 
spironolactone).  Given findings ___ and hyperkalemia on 
labwork, patient was instructed to present to the ___ ED for 
evaluation and management.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY:
================
___ with history of EtOH cirrhosis (Child's C, MELD 30, prior 
decompensations with HE, ascites, varices), dilated 
cardiomyopathy (EtOH related), recurrent epistaxis, and small 
intracranial hemorrhages who presented with findings of 
hyperkalemia and ___ on outpatient labs found to have volume 
overload by RHC, s/p Lasix gtt with rapidly rising BUN/Cr, now 
on HD with UF, and course further c/b anemia and possible 
NSTEMI.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==================
PLEASE DO NOT ADMIT THE PATIENT IF HE PRESENTS FOR TRANSFUSIONS 
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AS THIS IS NOT PER HIS GOALS OF CARE. 
CONSULT THE LIVER SERVICE AND ADMINISTER BLOOD AS NEEDED.
[ ] He had persistent GI blood loss anemia and epistaxis this 
admission. EGD notable for portal hypertensive gastropathy. This 
was likely from his coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia and uremia. 
He is being set up with the ___ here for future 
transfusions. He will be able to start this on ___ at ___, 
___, ___ floor, ___, 
___. Until then, he will have to go to the emergency room for 
transfusions. Hgb on discharge 7.3
[ ] He was intentionally NOT started on aspirin this admission 
given thrombocytopenia and high risk of IPH in the setting of 
possible CAA. Please prescribe with caution in the future. 
[ ] He was started on midodrine 5 mg TID prior to discharge in 
hopes of increasing SVR and thus reducing high output heart 
failure. He was thus intentionally not prescribed a beta blocker 
despite evidence of CAD.
[ ] He was started on dialysis and his discharge dialysis will 
be at ___ Dialysis ___, ___, 
___. Phone: ___. Nephrologist: Dr. 
___.
[ ] Weight on discharge 198lbs

ACUTE ISSUES:
============
# Renal Failure
# Hyperkalemia 
He presented after outpatient labs showed Cr elevated 2.0 from 
baseline 1.0-1.2, with associated hyperkalemia. Initially Cr did 
not improve with albumin, but after a combination of diuresis 
and albumin, trended back to baseline. However, patient's volume 
status did not improve and the decision was made to start Lasix 
gtt in order to augment diuresis. BUN and creatinine rose 
rapidly after starting Lasix gtt and BUN peaked at 196 and Cre 
4.5. Empiric treatment for HRS with midodrine and octreotide had 
no effect on kidney function. For management of both worsening 
uremia and volume status, the decision was made to start patient 
on HD with UF for volume management with hopes of improving 
volume status. He is scheduled for ___ dialysis on outpatient 
basis 

# EtOH Cirrhosis
# Volume Overload
Child's C, MELD-Na 19 on admission, prior decompensation with 
ascites/HE/varices. Patient had thorough workup for transplant 
candidacy during this admission. Due to volume overload on exam, 
cardiology recommended RH cath to evaluate hemodynamics given 
increase PASP seen on ECHO, and RHC confirmed extremely high 
filling pressures (R and L sided). Patient was diuresed as noted 
above and repeat RHC showed improved, though still elevated 
filling pressures. It was at that point that he started HD with 
UF in hopes of further improving volume status. Patient had a 
third RHC prior to discharge. This showed persistently elevated 
filling pressures, overall unchanged compared to prior RHC. 
Thus, despite HD with UF, patient has nearly identical pressures 
compared to before. Likely either due to lack of improvement in 
volume status (weight overall unchanged between second and third 
RHCs vs. intrinsic heart disease in the setting of liver failure 
(with vasodilation and thus high output HF). He will continue 
volume management with HD as an outpatient. He was ultimately 
turned down for transplant by the transplant committee due to 
his multiple medical comorbidities and his operative risk. 

# NSTEMI
He developed sudden onset chest discomfort, elevated troponin, 
and EKG changes during HD on ___. Presentation most consistent 
with demand ischemia (Type 2 NSTEMI). During final RHC, he also 
went cardiac catheterization to evaluate for CAD. This showed no 
evidence of flow-limited lesions with max 60% stenosis in 3 
major vessels. No further episodes of angina this admission. Per 
further discussions with cardiology, there was no indication 
that a higher hemoglobin transfusion threshold is indicated 
given overall mild CAD. He was transfused for Hgb goal of 7.0 
g/dL. 

# Coagulopathy 
# Macrocytic anemia
# History of AVMs
# Thrombocytopenia 
# GI Blood loss anemia
Patient required numerous blood product transfusions this 
admission. Etiology of anemia multifactorial. Partially GIB loss 
given EGD/colonoscopy in ___ showing both portal hypertensive 
gastropathy as well as vascular ectasias in the sigmoid, likely 
exacerbated by uremic platelet dysfunction. EGD with 1 cord of 
grade II varices and diffuse congestion, petechiae and mosaic 
mucosal pattern consistent with portal hypertension gastropathy 
which may be the source of bleeding. Repeat EGD ___ showed 1 
cord of grade II varices in the mid esophagus. Scarring was 
noted in the distal esophagus consistent with prior banding. 
Stomach with diffuse congestion, petechiae, and mosaic mucosal 
pattern compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy. His 
coagulopathy was worsened from likely uremic platelet 
dysfunction in the setting of renal failure. As an outpatient, 
he will be set up with a pheresis center to provide him with 
blood transfusions if needed without hospitalization. 

# Epistaxis
Evaluated by ENT for recurrent epistaxis this admission. 
Underwent cauterization ___. Given Afrin as needed for recurrent 
bleeding. Felt to be due to underlying coagulopathy. He required 
DDAVP to stop uremic bleeding for this. 

# Possible Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy
# Microbleeds on MRI
Patient noted to have spontaneous IPH with multiple microbleeds 
on MRI in ___. Neurology consulted at that time and felt to be 
consistent with possible cerebral amyloid angiopathy; unable to 
prognosticate however regarding the risks of future bleeding 
events. Patient noted to have periorbital ecchymoses this 
admission concerning for recurrent intracerebral bleed. However, 
2 repeat head CTs were both unrevealing and actually showed 
improvement in prior hemorrhage. Will need neurology follow up 
as an outpatient. Of note, all antiplatelet agents should be 
avoided if possible given persistent thrombocytopenia and 
concern for CAA as noted above.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
==============
# Poor Wound Healing 
Done as part of workup for possible amyloidosis (which was 
ultimately negative). S/p abdominal fat pad biopsy by ACS on 
___. No concern for communication with the peritoneal space or 
infection, ACS was consulted. Recommended ongoing dry dressing 
and felt there was good granulation tissue and would heal with 
secondary intention eventually. 

# Contact/HCP: ___ (sister) ___ 
# Code status: full code

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

WHY DID YOU COME TO THE HOSPITAL?
- Your lab values from clinic showed that your kidneys were not 
working well. 

WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU DURING YOUR HOSPITAL STAY?
- We investigated your heart (called a 'right heart 
catheterization') and found that it had very high pressures 
because of extra fluid. 
- We used strong medications (called 'diuretics') to help move 
the extra fluid to your kidneys so you could urinate it out. 
- Unfortunately, the diuretics did not work as well as we hoped 
and your kidney function worsened. You were started on dialysis 
to help treat the kidney problems and removed the extra fluid.
- You had another right heart catheterization to look at the 
pressures in your heart and the pressures were still very high.
- You had lots of bleeding, mostly from your nose and required 
many blood transfusions. This is because your platelets are not 
working well because of your kidney failure. 

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
- Take all of your medications as prescribed.
- Follow up with your doctors as ___ below.
- Attend all of your scheduled dialysis appointments.
- Go to the ER immediately if you notice significant blood in 
your stool or from your nose or if you become lightheaded.
- Please weigh yourself every morning and call your doctor if 
your weight increases or decreases by more than 3 pounds per 
day. Your weight on discharge is 198lbs
- If you have another nose bleed, please apply pressure to your 
nose and lean forward. Hold for 45 minutes to an hour or as soon 
as the bleeding stops. You can also use the afrin nasal spray as 
directed to you previously. If the nose bleed does not stop, 
please return to the emergency room

We wish you the best in your recovery and it was a pleasure to 
care for you. 

Your ___ Care Team
