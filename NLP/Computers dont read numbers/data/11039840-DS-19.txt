SSDI for psych and physical reasons as she expects this will 
land
her with a nice income and a nice apartment."

Per Dr ___ ___ ED Initial Psychiatry Consult note
"While initial notes report that patient was brought in on a S12

He notes that she has diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and has
intense mood swings throughout the day.  He thinks she is
compliant with her medications.  He also says that it's hard for
her to think clearly and move well because of her stroke.  He
said that she has been calling him from the emergency room to
threaten him: saying "I'm going to punish you," and "you don't
now what is in store for you."  He said that patient has never
been violent towards him before, but she does throw objects and
destroy property.  I counseled ___ to tell patient that she

Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission. She was placed on q15 minute checks 
status on admission. Given patient's provocative suicidal 
statements and intermittent outbursts, patient was changed to q5 
minute checks and restricted sharps. Of note, once patient's 
status was changed to restricted sharps and q5 minute checks, 
the patient reported that she never intended to harm herself and 
retracted her suicidal statements. 

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
On initial interview in the emergency room, Mr. ___ reported 
chronic depression due to her life stressors (substance abuse 
history, separation from her husband, conflicts with her son) 
and thinks about suicide, but denied actively intending to kill 
herself. She reported that she was trying to straighten out her 
social security payments, get connected to healthcare, get 
housing etc. She was noted to frequently make other demand, such 
as asking for ice cream, a milkshake, and demanding other food. 
On admission to the inpatient unit, the patient denied active 
suicidal ideation. During hospitalization, that patient 
continued to focus on assistance with housing, her dog in a 
shelter, and social security.  Multiple medication options were 
discussed with the patient, and prior pharmacy records were 
obtained. The patient's thorazine was discontinued and patient 
consented to start Latuda, which was up-titrated to 40 mg QHS. 
However, after a few days of taking Latuda, patient refused to 
continue the medication, reporting that the medication "made her 
cry." After a discussion with the patient, the patient was 
restarted on thorazine 10 mg QHS. Throughout hospitalization, 
patient was irritable and angry, often with outburst with 
profanity. Once the team started to discuss discharge planning, 
the patient became provocative, stating that she would commit 
suicide if discharged to a shelter. However, throughout 
hospitalization, the patient was continually future oriented, 
focusing on obtaining housing, obtaining her social security 
check, and having her dog become a ___ dog. No evidence of 
depression, mania, or psychosis. She appeared to use borderline 
defense mechanisms, and often attempted to split staff, 
requiring the entire team to meet with the patient together each 
day. The patient also frequently requested high doses of 
benzodiazepines, and perseverated on wanting Klonopin 
specifically. The team counseled the patient on the risks of 
long term use of benzodiazepines, however the patient was 
resistant to engage in a discussion about this. The patient 
agreed to apply for ___ services, and a ___ application was 
submitted. 

Throughout hospitalization, the team emphasized the importance 
of close outpatient follow up. The patient was recommend to 
follow up with a partial hospitalization program. ___ and 
___ were suggested to the patient. The patient refused 
PHP.
The patient was discharged with a follow up appointment with her 
PCP at ___ and additional resources for psychiatric follow 
up. Patient reported being in touch with Dr. ___, 
a PCP that she has seen years ago, and he is going to help 
arrange "a transfer."  Patient stated that she will go to ___ if 
she feels unsafe after discharge. The patient signed a release 
for Dr. ___ to speak with Dr. ___ reported that she 
is not currently his patient and is not arranging a transfer.

As inpatient treatment progressed, it became a very difficult 
situation. It was clear that there was no common treatment goal, 
patient's behaviors could be characterized
as abusive towards the staff, pt also has been negatively 
affecting milieu (e.g., encouraging other clients to decline 
ECT). On the other hand, pt makes conditional suicidal 
statements: e.g., she was threatening suicide last week if she
was discharged to the ___. Last days of treatment, pt made 
threats to kill herself because she "undermedicated" and she 
needed more time to be in the hospital. Considering pt's 
clinical presentation, and behavioral pattern over the hospital 
course, I believe that discharge would be the most helpful 
intervention for pt. Ms. ___
requires intensive outpatient treatment program (PHP, preferably 
for individuals with dual diagnoses). There were no legal 
grounds to impose treatment against patient's will. Pt 
effectively declined or sabotaged treatment/referral options 
offered to her.
Pt was again reminded about upcoming discharge and encouraged to 
accepts assistance we could offer. Despite pt's angry outbursts, 
she was reminded about her agency and past accomplishments. Pt 
was also reminded about positive choices she made (several
examples were mentioned to her).

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
Patient with a history of methamphetamine and cocaine use. She 
reports not using for past few months. STox/UTox in ED was 
negative. She continued to report motivation to continue 
abstinence from substances during hospitalization, as she would 
like to repair her relationship with her son. However, she 
continually asked for high doses of benzodiazepines throughout 
admission. The team counseled the patient on the risks of long 
term benzodiazepine use. 

4. MEDICAL
#Right Wrist Fracture
On admission, patient's right forearm was in a cast placed by an 
OSH. Patient was seen by hand surgery, who removed the cast. She 
was given a prefab splint and advised light use only. Patient 
given acetaminophen PRN for pain. Patient to follow up with 
___ hand clinic ___ at 3:30 ___. 

# Pseudoseizures
Patient reported having a history of seizures, and reported 
multiple recent episodes prior to hospitalization. On ___, 
patient reported having a seizure. ___ medical records 
were obtained. Per ___ records, MRI brain and CT head 
shows no acute abnormalities; however, nonspecific white matter 
changes are present, though these most likely are related to 
gliosis secondary to small vessel ischemic changes. Continuous 
EEG was apparently done at ___ showing intermittent scattered 
bilateral slowing and occasional right anterior temporal sharp 
transients, though this did not meet criteria for epileptiform 
discharges. Neurology was consulted. Per neurology, the 
patient's current seizure-like episodes that have occurred since 
her
stroke are atypical and more likely represent pseudoseizures.  
Neurology was also concerned about benzodiazepine-seeking 
behavior. No indication for AEDs.

#Hypothyroidism
Patient was continued on her home levothyroxine 175 mcg PO qAM. 
TSH wnl. 

#Hx gastric bypass:
Patient was continued on her home vitamin D. Ferrous gluconate 
was continued, however patient frequently refused this 
supplement. Nutrition was consulted and discussed with patient 
eating a healthy, well rounded diet, discussed menu options 
while in house, and provided patient with a healthy nutrition 
handout. 

#Constipation:
The patient was continued on her home regimen of docusate sodium 
100  mg BID and polyethylene glycol 17 g daily. 

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. She was 
often noted to be irritable, disinhibited, and using profanity 
with staff and peers in groups and in the milieu.  During 
hospitalization patient was sharps restricted after making 
provocative comments to staff, and afterwards perseverated on 
wanting to attend projects groups. When offered alternative 
activities she declined. In addition, nursing staff noted that 
patient would make provocative statement in the milieu, 
complaining about her team and discharge plans, upsetting other 
patients. The patient was also noted to encourage other patients 
to not participate in their treatment. 

#) Homelessness
Social work met with patient extensively during hospitalization. 
Patient rejected multiple housing options including sober 
housing, transitional programs or shelters. The patient often 
expressed interest in housing options that were not affordable. 
The patient reported that her foster brother was able to receive 
her disability check ($1198) and she has access to her money. At 
discharge, the patient reported that she had multiple places to 
stay, although was not able to engage in a meaningful 
conversation with staff about her options. 

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT

Per Dr. ___ patient's evaluation in the ED, 
patient's brother reported that he has been trying to connect 
patient to outpatient services, however she kept not following 
up.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting Thorazine, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any 
questions about medications with the treatment team.  The 
patient appeared able to understand and consented to begin the 
medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS

On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and others. Her static risk 
factors include history of suicide attempts, history of 
substance abuse, recent discharge from an inpatient psychiatric 
unit, Caucasian race, and marital status. Her modifiable risk 
factors included passive SI, impulsivity, lack of engagement 
with outpatient treatment, and limited social supports.  Of 
note, on admission, patient denied SI. However, in the context 
of discharge planning, the patient made conditional suicidal 
statements, stating that she would kill herself if she is 
discharged to a shelter. Throughout hospitalization, however she 
displayed significant future oriented behavior regarding 
searching for housing and securing her social security payment. 
She also reports a goal of having her dog declared a service dog 
so he is able to live with her. Once the patient's sharps status 
was changed due to her provocative statements, the patient 
retracted her statements and denied any intent to harm herself. 
In addition, the patient displayed a great deal of knowledge 
about the resources available to her. She reports motivation to 
reconcile with her son. She  does not have evidence of 
depression. No hopelessness or worthlessness. No symptoms of 
psychosis. Patient's other protective factors include good 
intellect, education, and help seeking behavior. She has a 
history of being able to establish working relationships with 
outpatient providers. Although the patient is chronically at 
risk of self harm, based on the totality of our assessment at 
this time, the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm nor danger to others due to the above protective 
factors. 

Our Prognosis of this patient is guarded.
