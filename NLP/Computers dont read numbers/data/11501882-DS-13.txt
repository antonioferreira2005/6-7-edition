IMAGING:  

CT CHEST W/O (___): 
"1. Moderate right pleural effusion with no underlying pneumonic
infiltrate. Mild atelectasis of the right lung base is noted. 
2. Unchanged calcified granulomas of the lung bases."

CXR PA&lat (___): "continued substantial right pleural effusion
with opacification above that most likely represents 
atelectasis"

CXR AP (___): "Right chest tube terminates at the apex.
Small-to-moderate right basilar lateral pneumothorax is present
as well as adjacent basilar atelectasis. Right pleural effusion
has nearly resolved. Subcutaneous emphysema is present in the
right chest wall. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal
limits. The left lung is remarkable for patchy and linear
atelectasis at the base."

CXR AP (___):  "The previously demonstrated pneumothorax is not
seen on the current study but there is increase in pleural
effusion that may be accumulating in the pleural space at least
partially obscuring the pneumothorax. The position of the right
chest tube is unchanged. Mediastinal position, contour and width
are stable. Bibasal atelectasis is unchanged. No evidence of
pulmonary edema is present."

CXR PA&lat (___): prelim = "Small hydropneumothorax following
right chest tube removal."

CXR PA&lat (___): read pending.  Decreased R pleural effusion. 
No sig increase in hydropneumothorax.  Mildly dilated colon.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Pleural Tuberculosis - The patient has a history of 
recurrent right sided pleural effusions and a positive PPD. He 
was electively admitted on ___ for elective VATS and pleural 
biopsy on ___.   The pleural biopsy  revealed many AFB, an 
inflamed parietal and visceral pleural with mulitple 
subcentimeter "small soft pleural nodules" was consistent with 
tuberculosis. Cultures are currently pending.  The infectious 
disease team was consulted.   The above constituted sufficient 
evidence to begin 4 drug treatment for pleural (non-parenchymal) 
tuberculosis.  He was not on respiratory precautions at D/C.  
The patient had LFT drawn before treatment was initiated and the 
results were normal.  An appointment was made for an outpatient 
ophthalmology exam as the patient will be on ethambutol.  The 
DPH was contacted and a report for suspicion of TB was sent. The 
patient will follow up with the ___ health department in 
___ for treatment surveillance.  The patient will follow up 
w/ Dr. ___ on ___.

undetectable viral load.  The decision was made to defer 
treatment with antivirals at this time.  The patient will follow 
up with Dr. ___ on ___. 

3.  Orthostatic hypotension.  On ___ am, when getting out of 
bed to chair, he felt nauseated, emesis, and lost consciousness. 
 Per trigger note, HR ___, SBP 60/40, POx 98%, "can't breathe", 
diaphoretic; rapidly resolved after IVF, without recurrence of 
symptoms or vitals instability since that time.  Orthostatic BP 
measurements were taken and the patients HR increased by 28 BPM 
when going from supine to standing position.  The patient was 
given 2L of fluids. Repeat orthostatic measurements were normal. 


4.  Urinary retention - The patient experienced transient 
urinary retention This was likely secondary to opioid pain 
medication s/p VATS procedure. UA was negative.  A single dose 
of tamsulosin was given.  The symptoms resolved within ___ 
hours.
