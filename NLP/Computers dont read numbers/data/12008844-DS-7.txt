melena.  

In the MICU, he was treated with tylenol for his high 
temperature and it defervesced.  He was given aggressive IV 
fluid hydration for his rhadomyolysis and CKs peaked and started 
to decrease the day before transfer to the floor.  He was 
monitored on tele and stayed in a normal sinus rhythm, although 
ekg changes suggested some evidence of heart disease from 
cocaine use.  Changes were nonspecific. (see below for EKG 
interpretations).  Psych was consulted and will continue to 
follow.  Pt continues to be paranoid and agitated.
.
Upon presentation to the floor, he was feeling ok.  Complains of 
diffuse pain in all of his body.  Most specifically, his R 
shoulder hurts and has limited ROM.  Does not complain of 
CP/SOB/palpitation.  Seems to still be paranoid and talking 
about the EMS who tried to kill him on the way to the hospital.  
Currently not having melena.  He received IVFs and his CK and 
LFTs trended downward.  He was seen and cleared by psych, and 
discharged in stable condition to home.  See below for specific 
problems and treatment.
.
# Cocaine overdose - Patient has known substance abuse hx. Pt. 
admits to "getting high" using crack cocaine.  During his 
hospitalization, he was continued on ativan PRN for agitation, 
which he did not require much.  His ECG showed no ischemic 
changes.  Psychiatry followed patient, who was also found on 
previous medical records to have been diagnosed with 
schizoaffective disorder.  Refused help for substance abuse 
problems. 
.  
# Melana- Cocaine use is assoc. w/ perforated ulcers.  Could be 
ischemic colitis, as well.  Pt. had several melanotic stools in 
ED. He was given 3units pRBCs.  During the rest of his 
hospitalization, he no longer had melanotic stools, and his HCT 
remained stable.  He was also given ppi IV BID, and then 
transitioned to oral protonix.  Would recommend colonoscopy in 
the future as an outpatient, but was not actively bleeding or 
having GI complaints on discharge. 
.  
# ARF: no baseline, crt initially 2.7, improved with hydration.  
This was likely in the setting of rhabdo.  Did not know 
baseline.  Discharged with Cr of 1.2.     
.  
# Rhabdomyolysis: likely ___ to crack-cocaine use. Rapidly 
increasing CKs (3000's trending to ___. Given 7L NS in the 
ED. Electrolytes were stable.  Was treated aggressively with 
hydration with D5 w/ bicarb (3amps).  IVFs were continued until 
the day before discharge.  Patient had good urine output 
throughout hospitalization. 
.  
# Hypernatremia: likely ___ to dehydration. Improved with D5W 
and had normal sodium by the time he was transferred to the 
floor.    
.  
# Agitation: Patient has been agitated ___ to crack-cocaine use. 
He also has a significant psych hx (?schizophrenia). He at times 
threatened to leave and to pull out his IV lines.  He was kept 
on psychiatry hold.  The day of discharge he was seen by 
psychiatry and evaluated.  It was determined he was safe to 
leave without further psych treatment.  He did not like having 
to been seen by a psychiatrist and often got agitated and angry 
during these visits. 
.  
# Pt is a full code.

He was discharged in stable condition.  He threatened to never 
return for his follow up visits, but by the time he left was 
calm again.  He left his aunt's phone number as a contact.
