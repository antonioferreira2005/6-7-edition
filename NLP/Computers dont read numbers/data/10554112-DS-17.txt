STUDIES
==================================
+ ___ CT BILAT LOWER EXTREMITY W&W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 
1. Soft tissue edema tracking into the deep, medial portion of 
the left lower extremity suggestive of deep cellulitis and 
possible myositis. No evidence of drainable fluid collection. 
There are a few small hypodense foci in the deep soft tissues of 
the medial calf, which may represent insinuating fat, but 
difficult to entirely exclude soft tissue gas. 
2. No acute fracture seen. 

+ ___ LOWER EXT VEINS
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower 
extremity veins within the limitations of this exam (see 
findings).

+ ___    CXR
AP portable upright view of the chest.  Lower lung opacity 
partially due to bilateral breast implants.  A TIPS shunt 
projects over the right upper abdomen.  An embolic coil is noted 
in the left upper quadrant.  The lungs appear clear without 
focal consolidation, large effusion or pneumothorax.  The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No signs of edema or 
congestion. Bony structures are intact.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with complex PMH including childhood CML s/p HSCT, RCC s/p 
nephrectomy, HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS and Harvoni, uterine rupture 
c/b cardiac arrest (EF recovered >55% in ___, moderate-severe 
pulmonary HTN, multiple prior admissions for myositis (believed 
to be infectious), admitted for recurrent severe bilateral leg 
pain x 3 days consistent with her prior episodes of myositis. 
She presented with leukocytosis to 30 and elevated lactate to 
3.5, but with stable hemodynamics. Although she had been treated 
with antibiotics on previous presentations, infection may be 
less likely as pt has never had a positive blood culture. She 
did have a positive urinalysis with GNRs in culture, although 
she was not having urinary symptoms. Rheumatology was consulted 
and did not feel that her presentation was an 
inflammatory/autoimmune phenomenon and did not recommend 
steroids. A tox screen was added on during admission, which 
noted a positive cocaine level in urine from admission, 
concerning for a possible cocaine-induced myopathy. A routine 
bed search was performed after this was explained to the 
patient. She insisted on being discharged AGAINST MEDICAL 
ADVICE. She was not discharged on any new medications. 

An MRI of the thigh and calf was ordered for further evaluation 
of myositis but not completed prior to discharge. Multiple labs 
tests were also pending upon discharge (see Results section).

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] Consider outpatient MRI of LLE to further evaluate myositis
[] Urine culture during hospitalization positive for E coli. 
Patient denied urinary symptoms. Consider treating for UTI if 
symptomatic.
[] Myositis antibody panel pending
[] HCV viral load positive this admission
 
Medications on Admission:

futher investigation.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ because of leg pain, similar to a 
presentation that you've had in the past. You were initially 
started on antibiotics but these were stopped because you were 
stable and we weren't convinced that you had an infection. We 
had consulted our infectious disease and rheumatology doctors to 
___ to help figure out your lab abnormalities and muscle pain. 
As part of our workup, we checked a toxicology screen, which was 
positive for cocaine. Cocaine can sometimes lead to problems 
with muscles. As a result, we felt obligated to perform a room 
search to protect your safety and for the safety of other 
patients. You chose to leave the hospital against medical 
advice. You were informed of the gravity of this situation and 
understood.

If at any time you start feeling worse and choose to come back 
to care, please do not hesitate to come to the ED.

- Your ___ Team
 
Followup Instructions:
