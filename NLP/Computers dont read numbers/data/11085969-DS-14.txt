Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
increased seizure frequency
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none
 
History of Present Illness:
___ year-old right-handed woman with a history of bipolar
disorder, ADD, depression, and convulsive episodes with a recent
diagnosis of epilepsy presents after increasing seizure 
frequency
over the past three days.  After presenting to the ED ___ 
(see
my note from that date ___ in the context of a seizure with
head trauma, she kept her follow-up appointment with her
epileptologists, Dr. ___ on ___
afternoon.  It was decided to switch to Keppra because the
oxcarbazepine was causing headache and because she needed a
medication that could be rapidly titrated.  Keppra was started 
at
500 mg BID with a titration plan.  Alprazolam was resumed at 
0.25
mg q am, to replace one of the three doses of lorazepam she was
taking daily, as the former medication has a longer half-life. 
There was also concern that the alprazolam was previously
discontinued too quickly.  Dr. ___ that ___ was
advised to have the switch done as an inpatient because of the
high frequency of seizures she's experiencing, but she preferred
to do it as an outpatient.... she was advised to come to the ED
if she has bad or prolonged seizures and then she would be
admitted." 

The patient had two seizures on ___, followed by two during
the daytime on ___.  On ___ night, she had
consecutive seizures, each lasting several minutes, without a
return to baseline between these two events.  The final seizure
was slightly prolonged, at ___ minutes, with a somewhat 
prolonged
post-ictal period (unspecified duration).  Today, she was told
that she would have to withdraw from classes at school given the
frequency of her events and concern for her safety.  This
evening, the patient had three further seizures in a 10 to 15
minute period.  The first seizure lasted 2 minutes, followed by 
a
30 second inter-ictal period, then another 3 minute seizure. 
This was followed by a five-minute event with a subsequent 
period
of impaired arousal for ~10 minutes.  All of these events were
described as her "typical" convulsive episodes.  Her mother
called EMS, and the patient was brought to the ___ ED, where
the patient had two additional seizures.  She received 1 mg IV
ativan for each event.  I witnessed the end of the second event,
which consisted of a convulsive episode with arms extended in 
the
air.

Review of systems:
Denies F/C, N/V/D.  She is taking her medications faithfully, 
and
reports eating and sleeping regularly.  Her mother believes that
her speech is "off" since starting oxcarbazepine.  She currently
denies headache, but continues to have ictal and inter-ictal
headaches as described in the prior note from ___.

 
Past Medical History:
-Recent diagnosis of epilepsy:
Her seizure history is well-detailed in recent notes.  On the
recent admission for EEG LTM from ___ to ___, she had
numerous seizures, including staring spells, leftward gaze
deviation, raising her arms, and left facial twitching
occasionally leading to full body convulsions.  The seizure 
focus
on EEG was bifrontal and right posterior, and ictal SPECT showed
increased uptake in the left frontal and temporal lobes. 
Interictal SPECT revealed increased uptake in the left temporal
region.  She was started oxcarbazepine 300 mg BID, which was
increased to 450 mg BID on ___.  Covered with Ativan 1 mg TID
for one day after the ictal SPECT, then next day to 1 mg BID,
then to 1 mg daily the following day.  She was discharged home 
on
0.5 mg Ativan po BID prn increased seizure frequency for two
weeks.  Of note, her lamotrigine was discontinued on admission
out of concern for increased seizure frequency on this
medication.
