Pathology (antrum/duodenal biopsies) ___: Pending at the

EGD/EUS ___:
The pancreatic parenchyma was evaluated and was hyperechoic as 
compared to the spleen. Pancreatic duct delineation was clear 
without obscuring visualization. Fine dots in the pancreatic 
parenchyma were clearly seen. These findings were found in the 
pancreatic head and uncinate process 
These findings are consistent with fatty pancreas. The liver 
parenchyma was evaluated and appeared to be normal. The pancreas 
duct measured 3 mm in maximum diameter in the head of the 
pancreas and 1.7 mm in maximum diameter in the body of the 
pancreas. The duct was normal in echotexture and contour. No 
intra-ductal stones were noted. No dilated side-branches were 
noted. The bile duct appeared normal in size. EGD was performed. 
Normal mucosa in the stomach (biopsy) Normal mucosa in the 
duodenum(biopsy) Otherwise normal upper EUS and EGD to second 
part of the duodenum

 
Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL SUMMARY: Patient is a ___ F who presents with acute on 
chronic abdominal pain (present to some degree for ___ years, 
significantly worse over the past 8 months, unbearable for 
several days prior to admission and ___ on presentation) as 
well as nausea and vomiting thought to be related to functional 
abdominal pain. She has had an extensive outpatient work up in 
the past and no etiology for her symptoms has ever been 
discovered (she does carry diagnoses of IBS and fibromyalgia, 
though it is unclear that these conditions would explain pain of 
this severity). During this admission, she was evaluated by the 
gastroenterology consult service who recommended inpatient EUS 
with EGD (had previously been scheduled for the same time as an 
outpatient). Biopsies of the antrum and duodenum were taken, but 
the study overall was unremarkable. She was evaluated by the 
pain service for her uncontrolled pain, who recommended in-house 
dose of toradol (she does have a history of GI bleed and should 
not be on NSAIDs longterm, but given the extent of her pain it 
was determined that for a one-time dose benefits may outweigh 
risks). They also recommended re-trial of TCA (she has tried 
amitryptiline and nortryptiline in the past without significant 
improvement, though it has been some time since she tried TCA 
and she is now on different complementary medications). However, 
the patient preferred to discuss TCA trial with her outpatient 
pain specialist, so TCA was not initiated in-house. Finally, 
they recommended pursuing further alternative medicine 
techniques, including acupuncture and mind-body medicine. Given 
her obvious distress over the degree of her pain, she was also 
seen by social work (___) and provided with resources 
to assist with coping in the outpatient setting. Her outpatient 
pain doctor ___ in ___) was contacted regarding 
her pain med regimen, and a discrepancy was noted between his 
records (oxycodone 30 mg TID, clonazepam 1 mg BID) and the 
patient's practice (oxycodone 60 mg TID, and clonazepam 2 mg 
BID). Given the degree of the patient's pain and 
mental/emotional stress and the fact that prescriptions had been 
written in such a way as to allow for the doses she was using, 
no changes were made to her medication regimen. She will follow 
up with Dr. ___ to alert him to her current practice 
and discuss adjustments as an outpatient. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# ABDOMINAL PAIN: Course as above. MRI and CT scans were 
uploaded to PACS. She was continued on home doses of oxycodone 
and initially received IV dilaudid in addition for pain; this 
was stopped as it appeared to confer limited benefit. Nexium was 
changed to omeprazole while in-house. Reglan, 
diphenoxylate-atropine, gabapentin, ranitidine, and dicyclomine 
were continued at home doses. 
  
# ABNORMAL NEUROENDOCRINE STUDIES: Patient was noted to have 
elevated chromogranin A to 148 (range 1.9-15.0) and seratonin 
elevated to 289 (reference ___ in ___. Per patient, 
she later had these studies repeated at an outside lab (Quest) 
and results were similar (faxed to Dr. ___ not in our 
system). There is potential for carcinoid tumor, which could 
possibly explain her chronic diarrhea and other systemic 
symptoms (occasional episodes of flushing) though seems less 
likely to explain chronic ___ pain. She has had a recent 
abdominal MRI (patient brought image on disk and it was uploaded 
into PACS) which did not show any evidence of tumor. She was 
encouraged to follow up on these abnormal studies with her PCP 
and Dr. ___ and to obtain an additional referral if needed.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# MOOD/SLEEP: Patient denies symptoms recently; was diagnosed 
with depression "years ago" but feels mood has been stable. 
Continued clonazepam at patient's self-reported dose. Contined 
ambien.
   
# HYPERTIGLYCERIDEMIA: Held gemfibrozil as may contribute to 
diarrhea, abdominal pain. Patient will follow up with her PCP 
regarding ___ use.

# HYPERTENSION: Normotensive during this admission. Metoprolol 
and lisinopril were initially held.

TRANSITION OF CARE:
- She has follow up scheduled with her outpatient pain provider 
___ she will discuss dosing of pain medications 
at this visit.
- She has follow up scheduled with Dr. ___ ___, who will 
need to follow up the biopsies taken during EGD (pathology 
pending at discharge).

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ with worsening abdominal pain. You 
were evaluated by the gastroenterology service, who performed 
endoscopic ultrasound with upper endoscopy. No significant 
abnormalities were noted that would explain your symptoms. You 
were also seen by the pain consult service, who recommended some
