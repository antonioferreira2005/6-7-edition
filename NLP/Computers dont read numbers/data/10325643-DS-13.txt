IMAGING
============
___ CAROTID/CEREBRAL UNILAT
1. A long-standing fusiform dilation of the distal left internal 
carotid 
artery.  This appears to be stable based on previous reports 
from ___.  No aneurysmal abnormalities 
identified. 

___ FEMORAL ULTRASOUND
  No evidence of hematoma or pseudoaneurysm in the right groin. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, the patient presented to the ED with complaints of 
increased dizziness, difficulty focusion and left sided headache 
and neck pain and syncopal/near-syncopal episodes.  He has had 
multiple ED visits for similar complaints.  

On ___, Given his history of left intracranial 
paraclinoid/supraclinoid ICA aneurysm, he was taken for 
diagnostic angiogram which did not reveal an aneurysm, but a 
normal ICA variant. Neurology and medicine were consulted for 
evaluation of his headaches and syncopal episodes.  Overnight, 
he experienced groin pain and a femoral ultrasound was ordered 
which was negative for hematoma or pseudoaneurysm in the right 
groin.

On ___, the patient remained neurologically intact. He was 
ambulating independently, tolerating a diet, and voiding without 
difficulty. His pain was well-controlled. It was determined he 
would be discharged to home with instructions to follow-up with
