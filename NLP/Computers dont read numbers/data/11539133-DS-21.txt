Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o male admitted through the emergency room from his 
dialysis unit with a thrombosed graft. Ultrsound on admission 
shows an occlusive thrombosis along the entire length of the 
right arteriovenous graft. The graft had been placed on ___ 
and had been successfully used. 
He was taken to the OR on ___ with Dr ___ initially 
for a graft thrombectomy. However, once into the arm, it was 
quickly noted that the graft was completely unincorporated and 
therefore grossly infected, however there was no pus. The 
incision was extended toward the venous anastomosis until 
incorporated graft was found. Approximately 4 cm of graft was 
excised. The limbs were oversewn, cultures were sent, the 
patient tolerated the procedure without complication. 
The AV graft specimen showed no growth on culture.
The patient received IV Vancomycin per HD protocol.
On ___ he underwent successful placement of tunneled access 
catheter through the left internal jugular vein approach, with 
the tip located in the right atrium and the catheter ready for 
use. 
Following line placement he was taken to hemodialysis, and 
received a 4 hour treatment with 4.5 liters removed. However, 
since he had not received dialysis in 4 days, the nephrology 
team thought it beneficial to complete another HD run on 
___, then discharge back to his regular dialysis unit 
schedule of ___. He will continue antibiotics for 2 weeks, 
followed by one week off antibiotics, and if he remains well and 
afebrile, we will proceed with graft revision.
The patient was scheduled for a jump graft placement on ___.
