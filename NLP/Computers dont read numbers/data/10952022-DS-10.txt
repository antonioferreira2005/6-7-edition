EKG:NSR

Radiologic Data:
NCHCT:No CT evidence of acute intracranial process

MRI neck soft tissues: IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities 
on MRI of the neck identified. No mass lesion is seen or 
significant lymphadenopathy is seen.

MRI head:
IMPRESSION: Cavernous malformation in the right parietal region 
without acute or subacute hemorrhage with an associated 
developmental venous anomaly. No other areas of abnormal 
enhancement seen or acute infarct seen. 
 
MRA HEAD:  
The head MRA demonstrates small size of the right distal 
vertebral artery 
which could be due to slow flow or due to congenital hypoplasia. 
The proximal right vertebral artery was suspected to be abnormal 
on accompanying MRA of the neck and CTA was recommended. 
Otherwise, the MRA of the head is unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: Except for small caliber of the distal right 
vertebral artery as discussed above, no other abnormalities on 
MRA of the head.

MRA neck:
IMPRESSION: Questionable irregularity of the proximal portion of 
the right 
vertebral artery. To exclude dissection, CT angiography is 
recommended. The remaining arteries are patent in the neck.

CTA neck:
IMPRESSION: Normal CTA of the neck. No evidence of dissection. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the neurology serivce on ___ due 
to right facial pain and dysarthria. His symptoms were most 
consistent with glossopharyngeal neuralgia. MRI/A head as well

lesion or vascular abnormality such as dissection. MRI head and 
neck were unremarkable. MRA showed a questionable irregularity 
of the proximal right vertebral artery; CTA was subsequently 
negative. He was started on carbamazepine 200mg BID for his 
glossopharyngeal neuralgia and also given percocet prn for 
breakthrough pain. He was also started on aspirin 81mg.
