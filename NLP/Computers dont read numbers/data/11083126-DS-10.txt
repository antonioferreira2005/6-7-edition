Reports

ECG
Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Primary T wave 
abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of ___ right bundle-branch 
block is new. 

Echo
MPRESSION: Small echobright density associated with the anterior 
mitral valve chordae, possibly representing focal calcification 
or healed vegetation. Mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular 
systolic function. Mildly dilated aortic root.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the 
findings are similar and the appearance and size of the mass 
associated with the mitral valve is unchanged.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo male with past medical history significant for pancreatic 
dysplagia s/p Whipple, DM, HTN, and mitral valve mass with an 
episode of syncope.

#Syncope- Pt's history of small mitral valve abnormality was 
initially concerning for cardiac cause but repeat echo did not 
show much of a change in this.  ECG did show a new RBBB- it was 
unclear whether this was significant or not.  Telemetry did not 
reveal any arrhythmias overnight.  Orthostatics, however were 
positive and they continued to be positive throughout his stay 
until he was s/p 3L IVF boluses.  Orthostatic hypotension was 
considered the most likely cause.  We didn't get a very strong 
history for decreased PO intake, however, so POTS was also 
entertained given he has had these episodes in the past.  Of 
course, vasovagals were not ruled out as an etiology.  Patient 
was discharged with ___ of hearts to be followed up by his 
PCP and the number with the neurology clinic.

#Rash- Pt had a rash on RLE which he said was chronic in nature. 
 The presentation was most consistent with fungal infection vs. 
eczema.  He was given a topical azole and instructed to follow 
up with his PCP

#. DM- held metformin and continued NPH 10 units with ISS

# HTN
- continued lisinopril 40 mg
- continued hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg

# HL
-continued simvastatin 10 mg daily

Transitional Issues
-We are discharging the patient with ___ of hearts monitor. 
His PCP, ___ has been listed to follow up on the 
monitor

-We also discharged the patient on topical clotrimazole for his 
RLE rash which appeared fungal in nature. He will need f/u for 
this.

-Lastly, patient's sodium on discharge was 132. This should be 
repeated at follow up

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for syncope.  We obtained an 
echocardiogram of your heart which did not show any change from 
prior.  We also obtained orthostatics on you which showed your 
blood volume and hydration status was a bit low, and we gave you 
2 liters of fluid through the IV.  You were also ruled out for a 
heart attack.  It is likely your syncope was due to a 
"vasovagal", which means that your nervous system overactivated 
and became too relaxed.  Additionally, it is possible your body 
doesn't tolerate changes in position well, which may be 
indicative of a syndrome called POTS, or postural tachycardia 
syndrome.  Please follow up with your PCP regarding your syncope

-You were discharged with a heart monitor called ___ of hearts. 
 Please follow up with Dr. ___ the recording

 
Followup Instructions:
___
