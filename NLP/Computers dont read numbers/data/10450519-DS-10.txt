Urine and blood cultures neg/pending

___ ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with mild inferior wall hypokinesis. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic 
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate to 
severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation 
is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the left ventricular function is low normal with worsened mitral 
regurgitation and aortic stenosis.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with history of COPD, presenting with acute 
respiratory distress  
.  
#. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Pt was initially treated for COPD 
exacerbation with IV steroids, nebs and antibiotics. By the next 
day, pt was able to be weaned from bipap to 3L NC and was 
satting comfortably in the mid ___.  Given elevation in troponin 
however and evidence of mild pulmonary edema on CXR and 
peripheral edema, there was concern for CHF. A TTE confirmed 
worsening valvular disease compared to ECHO preformed several 
months prior.  Pt. was seen by cardiology who recommended BB if 
tol. by COPD, no other interventions.  They felt he was 
euvolemic at the time of examination and recommended against 
further diuresis. 
.  
#. NSTEMI: Pt's troponin peaked at .23 on admission. He had had 
no prior known cardiac disease, and was never seen by a 
cardiologist. EKGs were repeatedly at baseline. He was treated 
with full dose aspirin, statin and was started on low dose beta 
blocker with holding parameters at HR <70 to avoid poor filling. 
Pt was seen by cardiology who felt he was medically optimized. 
.  
#. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Pt remained at his recently new 
baseline of 2.5. 

#. Hypertension: Home BP meds were intially held as his regimen 
was adjusted for new worsening valvular disease and NSTEMI.
