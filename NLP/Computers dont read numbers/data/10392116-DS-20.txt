Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ yo female with past medical history of 
chronic watery rhinorrea, esophagitis, and GERD, who presented 
with throat pain in the setting of fever, worsening runny nose, 
and cough, suggestive of viral upper respiratory infection.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Throat pain:
Initially, the patient reported chest pain, which raised concern 
for cardiac pain or severe esophagitis. Trops were negative and 
ECG showed no ischemic changed. Upon further questioning, she 
clarified that she had no chest pain but rather throat pain. Her 
symptoms were likely due to upper respiratory viral infection. 
Per review of records, she saw ENT on ___ for throat chronic 
rhinorrhea. At that time, an endoscopy was performed and showed 
normal hypopharynx and larynx, mild reflux changes, and no 
glottic abnormality. She was able to tolerate PO intake and her
throat pain has improved. She had symptomatic relief with 
lozenges PRN.

#Fevers: She was febrile in ED to 101.3 with cough and sore 
throat. Exam was benign and there was no leukocytosis on labs. 
UA bland. CXR with biapical scarring though no definitive 
consolidation. CT chest without any findings which would explain 
fevers. Her symptoms are likely due to upper respiratory viral 
infection. She received conservative treatment.

#GERD: Patient with long-standing and significant issues with 
GERD. Initially her symptoms were thought to be due to severe 
GERD, though patient clarified that had throat pain and not 
chest/epigastric pain. She was treated with BID PPI and 
ranitidine.

#Hyponatremia: Likely in the setting of poor PO intake. 
Encouraged PO intake.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Esophageal spasm
#Atypical chest pain: Continued verapamil.

#Anxiety: Continued PRN ativan.

#Allergic rhinitis: Fluticasone while in house as home 
azelastine not on formulary.

her meals
- Consider follow-up with ENT in case her symptoms persist
