Imaging:
===================
___: As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant 
change is seen.  The bilateral chest tubes are in unchanged 
position.  Unchanged extent of the large right loculated fluid 
collection.  On the left, the lung basis is better ventilated 
than on the previous image.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Air 
collection in the right cervical soft tissues. 
.
___ CTA: 
The aorta and its major branch vessels are patent, with no 
evidence of 
stenosis, occlusion, dissection, or aneurysmal formation. There 
is no evidence of penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer or aortic 
arch atheroma present. 
  
Evaluation of the pulmonary arteries is limited by respiratory 
motion 
artifact.  No filling defect in the main and lobar pulmonary 
arteries. 
No axillary or prevascular lymphadenopathy.  Enhancing soft 
tissue in the 
subcarinal region (02:49) is concerning for lymphadenopathy.  
Additionally, in the right hilus, increased soft tissue fluid 
represent lymphadenopathy. There is a large multi-loculated 
right pleural effusion, and a small left pleural effusion. Left 
mainstem, left upper and lower lobe bronchi are patent.  The 
right upper lobe bronchus is patent, however after the takeoff 
of the right upper lobe bronchus, there is occlusion of the 
bronchus intermedius, with collapse of the right middle and 
lower lobes. In the aerated portion of the right upper lobe, 
there is peribronchovascular consolidation and ground-glass 
opacity which could represent pneumonia.  Given the history of 
malignant cells in the pleural effusion, this raises the concern 
for lymphangitic spread of tumor.  Hypoattenuating right middle 
and lower lobe consolidation is concerning for tumor or 
infection.  Additionally, hypoattenuating left lung base raises 
the concern for tumoral involvement and/or infection. This exam 
is not tailored for evaluation of the subdiaphragmatic regions, 
which are minimally included. No concerning osseous lesions. 

IMPRESSION:  
1.  No definite evidence of pulmonary embolism allowing for 
respiratory motion artifact. 
2.  Multiloculated nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion and 
small left 
pleural effusion. 
3.  Occlusion of the bronchus intermedius with collapse of the 
right middle and lower lobes. 
4.  Bibasilar pulmonary consolidation which is hypoattenuating, 
concerning for infection/tumoral involvement.

>> PRIOR PATHOLOGY: 
- METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, infiltrating dense fibrous tissue, 
see Note.
- Immunohistochemical stains show the following profile in 
lesional cells:
Positive - ___, CK7, EMA, Calretinin, CK5/6 (patchy), mCEA 
(focal), CDX-2 (rare cells)
Negative - TTF-1, Napsin-A, WT-1, D2-40, CK20, p63, PAX-8, ER, 
PR, GCDFP-15, Mammaglobin,
S100, Melan-A
- A mucicarmine stain is positive in rare tumor cells.
2. Pleural biopsy, right, #2:
___
Department of Pathology Patient: ___ 2 of 3
- METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, infiltrating dense fibrous tissue, 
see Note.
Note: The tumor has an epithelioid morphology with an 
infiltrative solid and cribriform growth pattern,
and benign-appearing mesothelial cells are lining the overlying 
pleural surface. The tumor cell
morphology and immunohistochemical staining profile is somewhat 
non-specific as to primary site.
The differential diagnosis would include upper GI or 
pancreaticobiliary, and somewhat less likely
lung (given the negative TTF-1 and Napsin-A), breast (given the 
negative ER, PR, Mammaglobin,
and GCDFP-15), or ovarian/endometrial (given the negative PAX-8, 
ER, and PR), among others.
Clinical and radiologic correlation is advised.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old female with past medical history of 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, known pulmonary 
metastases with malignant pleural effusion, admitted ___ 
with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to large 
malignant pleural effusions and concern for acute bacterial 
pnuemonia, requiring admission to the ICU for bipap, 
subsequently found to have significant progression of cancer, 
with malignant effusions drained with bilateral chest tubes, 
which were subsequently removed, with persistent symptoms 
thought due to severe disease burden, not a candidate for 
additional chemo/XRT, discharged to inpatient hospice.
.
>> ACTIVE ISSUES: 
# Acute and Chronic Hypoxic Respiratory Failure / Lung Cancer / 
Malignant Pleural Effusion: Upon admission, patient underwent a 
CTA chest revealed loculated nonhemorrhagic right pleural 
effusion and small left pleural effusion. Patient with known 
metastatic effusion diagnosed during prior hospitalization, with 
recent removal of pleurex on ___. Patient was found to require 
face tent for oxygenation, and therefore was initially admitted 
to the ICU for respiratory monitoring. Left chest tube to water 
seal and Right chest tube to suction were placed by IP on 
___ with substantial output initially. Patient's course 
was challenging in the setting of treating the underlying cause 
which was suspected malignance. Patient has undergone workup 
revealing a metastatic adenocarcinoma, however was unable to 
isolate a primary source, although pathology concerning for a GI 
malignancy. Patient was treated with vancomycin/zosyn to cover 
for possible obstructive type infection, and this was 
down-titrated to levofloxacin to finish a course. Patient 
started to have improvement in oxygenation, requiring 
supplemental ___, however becomes acutely dyspneic upon 
movement, and unable to lay flat without feeling acutely 
dyspneic. Patient seeking second opinion (see below), regarding 
treatment. Heme/onc recommended staging tests to search for a 
primary malignancy, however, the patient was unable to lie flat 
for these tests due to her poor respiratory status. As such, 
these tests were deferred as heme/onc felt that the patient 
would almost certainly be unable to undergo chemotherapy 
regardless of the results given functional status. Radiation 
oncology was also consulted and felt treatment may not be 
helpful due to likely lymphangitic spread, and the fact that RT 
would be unlikely to sufficiently decrease her tumor burden to 
the point that her respiratory status would improve. The patient 
was gradually weaned from facemask onto a nasal cannula before 
she was called out to the floor. Patient's chest tubes were 
clamped upon arrival to the medical floor, and ultrasound done 
by IP at beside revealed no free fluid in the bases, and 
effusion in the apex not amenable to chest tube placement. 
. 
# Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary: Diagnosed by 
pleural biopsy in ___. Per pathology, DDx includes upper GI 
or pancreaticobiliary. Patient had not yet established care with 
oncology as progression had been very quick. The patient was 
scheduled for CT head and PET scan. This could not be done 
inpatient given inability to lie flat and given extent of 
disease, it wouldn't change management from an oncology point of 
view. As above Radiation oncology was consulted who felt 
treatment may not be of great utility, and risks may outweight 
benefit given functional status. Patient had requested second 
opinion at ___, and results/imaging were faxed to ___ GI 
Malignancy Department, and reportedly reviewed by Dr. ___. 
___ aware that patient is unable to undergo CT Torso as 
requested given acute dyspnea, and planning to set patient with 
outpatient follow up. Patient was given contact information 
prior to discharge. 
. 
# Palliative Care/Goals of Care: Patient was initially admitted 
to the ICU as full code, however given grave prognosis and 
aggressive complications of underlying malignancy, social work 
and palliative care continued to work with patient and her 
family regarding optimizing her goals of care. Patient was 
transitioned to DNR/DNI per request, but with desire for 
re-hospitalization and re-transfer to the ICU if needed. Patient 
was considered for inpatient hospice given chest tubes, oxygen 
requirements, pain relievers, and acute significant decline in 
functional status, and this was arranged prior to her discharge. 
Patient was also started on mirtazapine as a sleep aid with good 
effect, and was continued on pain regimen which was controlled 
prior to discharge. 
. 
>> TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
# Metastatic Adenocarcinoma: Seeking ___ opinion at ___, 
patient's ___ records were sent to ___, however she was 
unable to complete a CT Torso given inability to lay flat 
safely. ___ made aware.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay 
at ___. You were admitted to the 
hospital after feeling short of breath at home, and found to 
have re-accumulation of fluid in your lungs. Therefore, you were 
transferred to our intensive care unit, and seen by our 
interventional pulmonary specialists who placed a chest tube to 
help drain this fluid. You started to have improvement in your 
symptoms, and were then discharged to the medical floor at which 
point it was decided to remove the chest tubes.

We have discussed that this fluid is the result of an underlying 
cancer, and you were seen by our radiation oncologists and
