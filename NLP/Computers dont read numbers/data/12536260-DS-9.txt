CTA AORTA/BIFEM/ILIAC RUNOFF W/W&WO C AND RECONS ___
IMPRESSION:  
  
Occlusion of the right distal superficial femoral artery (3B: 
779). No 
evidence of flow within the right popliteal artery. Trace flow 
within the 
posterior tibial artery is identified via filling through 
collaterals 
beginning at the level of the proximal calf. Minimal flow is 
identified in the 
peroneal artery to the level of the ankle, via collateral 
filling. No flow is 
clearly identified in the anterior tibial artery on the right. 
  
Left leg: Three-vessel runoff to the level of the proximal calf. 
Trace flow 
within the anterior tibial artery seen to the level of the mid 
left calf. Flow 
within the peroneal and posterior tibial arteries is seen to the 
level of the 
ankle. 
  
Enlarged bladder and trabeculated prostate.  Hepatic steatosis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year old male who was seen and evaluated by 
the vascular surgery service on ___.  The patient was found 
to have an occlusion of his distal superficial femoral artery on 
CTA and an emergent embolectomy was indicated.  The patient 
reported ___ pain but showed decreased motor function, yet 
indicated he did not want to have surgery.  Our team stressed to 
the patient and family the need for emergent surgery, and 
eventually the patient was amenable to the procedure.  Of note, 
both the patient and a son signed the consent form.  It was 
later brought to our attention that the son provided a 
fraudulent health care proxy sheet, and our social work and 
legal teams settled the matter and new documents showing his 
eldest daughter to be health care proxy were signed.

The patient underwent below knee popliteal embolectomy on 
___.  The procedure was uncomplicated and the patient 
tolerated it well.  For details of the surgery, please see the 
surgeons detailed operative note.  A post operative check was 
satisfactory. The patient was continued on a heparin drip 
overnight.

On the early morning of POD#1, the patient became confused and 
delirious and attempted to remove all lines and his telemetry 
monitoring system.  Because of this, he was restrained in his 
bed overnight.  His foot appeared to have a pinkish color and 
was warmer to the touch.  Our team decided to discontinue the 
heparin drip and start Lovenox in an attempt to remove lines and 
other aggravating factors from this usually pleasant ___ year old 
man.

On POD#2 from the original procedure (___), his foot 
appeared to have much darker color from POD#1 and was cooler to 
the touch. He was taken to the OR for diagnostic angiogram.  
This found poor arterial flow to the lower extremity, and it is 
believed this patient will eventually require an above knee 
amputation.  This was communicated to the health care proxy and 
palliative care was consulted as well.  A family meeting took 
place on ___ and the decision was made to take the patient 
home and see how he and his leg progress.  It is unlikely the 
patient will ever be amenable to above knee amputation per the 
health care proxy.  On ___ he was discharged to home with 
follow up appointments with Dr. ___ his PCP.
