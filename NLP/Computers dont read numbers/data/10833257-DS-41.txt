treatment ___, HTN, Afib on apixaban, and SSS s/p PPM who
presents with fever. 

He reported possible onset of R-sided abdominal pain last night
(but denied later on repeat questioning) without nausea, emesis,
CP, SOB, melena, hematochezia or dysuria. In the ED, he reported
that he had an episode of diarrhea the day before (although on
the floor, he also denied this).

sidewall soft tissue density lesion.
5. Extensive diverticulosis of the bladder, unchanged from the

2. Interval increase in moderate cardiomegaly. 

___ CT A/P with Contrast
1. No finding in the abdomen/pelvis to explain the patient's

ventricle. Severe tricuspid regurgitation. Low normal global 
right ventricular systolic function. At
least moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary 
hypertension. Small pericardial
effusion without evidence for tamponade.
Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___ , 
possible vegetation seen on the
tricuspid valve, there is more tricuspid regurgitation, the 
right ventricle is more dilated and hypokinetic,
the left ventricle is less vigorous.

___
1.  Interval improvement of mild pulmonary edema. 
2.  Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions. 
3.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY: ___ ___ with PMH HfPEF 58%, TR, CKD III (Cr 1.5), 
Afib on apixaban, SSS s/p PPM, HTN who presents with fever. +/- 
abdominal pain, left flank pain. Found to have blood cx growing 
S. bovis concerning for colon cancer. He was management 
conservatively given his goals of care, and was discharged to a 
skilled nursing facility with IV antibiotics.

ACUTE ISSUES
===================
#Bacteremia 
#Sepsis
#Endocarditis
He presented with fever and was found to have positive blood 
cultures growing GPCs (no GNRs). Initially thought to be d/t 
recent instrumentation for ___ stent placement but now with 
echo showing vegetation and BCx speciated to s. Bovis. This 
association is well known to be correlated with colon cancer. 
Additionally it is possible and highly likely that the lead of 
the pacemaker is also infected per the echo. Of note, the 
patient has a history of basal cell cancer which he and his 
family chose not to pursue treatment for. Additionally, CT scan 
did not show any colonic pathology, though this was a CTA and 
not a barium contrast study. urine legionella negative. He 
received vancomycin and ceftriaxone, but eventually transitioned 
to IV Ceftriaxone 2g q24hr for a total 4 week course ___ - 
___. A PICC was placed on ___. Cardiology was consulted and 
suggested TEE. However, this was not within patient's goals of 
care, per his daughter. Removal of pacemaker is also not within 
goals of care. 
- Pt needs weekly CBC with diff, BUN, Cr, AST, ALT, Tbili, Alk 
phos and CRP

# Hypoxia- 2L NC
# Elevated BNP- at baseline
# Chronic HFpEF
# Acute decompensated heart failure 
His normal regimen is Torsemide 40mg daily and, PRN metolazone 
2.5mg. His BNP on admission was 2200s, at baseline (last BNP 
also ___ in early ___ but with CXR showed congestion at 
admission. His weight is 160lb which is similar to his discharge 
weight of 159lb in ___, during which he was clinically 
euvolemic. He required O2 intermittently at 2L and was found to 
have crackles in lung bases, with JVD, and edema extending 
higher than on admission. CXR with interval improvement of mild 
pulmonary edema and stable as of ___. His metoprolol was 
continued for his tachycardia ___ A. fib found on EKG. His 
Lisinopril and isosorbide mononitrate were held given concern 
for infection as well as ___.

# ___ on CKD: 
He has baseline CKD III with Cr 1.2-1.6. Most recent Cr was 1.5 
in ___, now presenting with Cr 2.3 and increased to 3.2, 
was 2.6 on day of discharge. This could be secondary to ATN in 
setting of sepsis (although should be improved by now given 
normotension while in house) vs. contrast-induced nephropathy 
(received contrast on ___ vs. obstruction (has required 
frequent straight caths) vs. cardiorenal syndrome (but not 
overtly volume overloaded on exam, CXR stable, did not respond 
well to IV diuresis). A renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis. 
Intermittent hemodialysis was discussed but the patient 
determined that was not within his goals of care. Foley catheter 
was placed on day of discharge for continued urinary retention. 
He should get a foley trial as an outpatient in about one week 
with Urology.

Stable issues:
==============
#Acute coronary syndrome (Stable, resolved)
Patient complained of CP radiating to L arm with a pressure like 
feeling, SOB, and had emesis x1 on day 3 of hospitalization. His 
sx also improved with NG. Trop elevated to 0.13, then 0.11. CKMB 
10. EKG with no changes appreciated. Cardiology informed and 
followed; no heparin drip was indicated given downtrending 
troponins. He received nitroglycerin sublingual x 3 with some 
resolution of pain, Aspirin 325mg, and Atorvastatin 80mg for 
this episode. 

#Pyuria- Stable
His pyuria, leukocystosis, flank pain, and frequent urination 
were initially concerning for pyelonephritis. Of note, he was 
previously pan-sensitive pseudomonas but also note suspicion for 
chronic colonization. At last admission, pt had urinary 
frequency but UTI was not treated since he improved with C.diff 
treatment. His current left back pain seems secondary to MSK 
strain. CT scan did not show any abdominal pathology and given 
his relatively normal LFTs, will not continue to trend or 
evaluate with ultrasound. On exam he has no CVA tenderness and 
his pain is reproducible by palpation of the upper hip, thus it 
is most likely to be musculoskeletal. A urine culture did show 
pseudomonas colonization but without urinary symptoms, 
antibiotic treatment was deferred.  

# Lactic acidosis (Resolved)
It peaked to 2.7, improved to 1.6 on recheck without fluids.

# Thrombocytopenia:
He has multiple ecchymosis over extremities and even truncal 
area, likely due to triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel and 
Apixaban. Aspirin was discontinued in consultation with his 
vascular surgeon given his recent lower extremity stent 
placement. His platelet count on discharge was 118, and multiple 
ecchymoses with skin tearing and bleeding on the extremities 
were persistent.

# Anemia: 
His Hgb is 8.2, baseline around 8. It could be related to CKD 
with poor EPO production vs anemia of chronic disease. No active 
bleeding identified. On vitamin B12 although notably his recent 
Vit B12 level was > ___ in ___ and his anemia is not 
macrocytic. He has also since been d/c-ed off methotrexate. His 
home vitamin B12 and folate were continued. He received 1U blood 
on ___. His discharge Hgb was 7.1, and he may require frequent 
transfusions.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Goals of care: 
DNR/DNI was confirmed ___. He wishes to "go in peace". MOLST 
form was signed.

# Lower extremity insufficiency- s/p recent stent placement.
He noted some mild pain related to procedure, His Plavix and 
apixaban were continued, aspirin d/c'd given above conversation 
with vascular surgeon.

# SSS s/p Pacemaker
It was last interrogated by Dr. ___ on ___ and was noted 
to be functioning well without arrhythmias

# Benign prostatic hypertrophy
Finasteride was continued. Tamsulosin was added.

# Hx of HCV infection: 
This was documented on prior discharge summary with plan for 
Hepatology follow-up. Later, on ___, patient reported to Dr. 
___ that he wanted to minimize MD appointments 
and did not want to see Hepatology. "does not want to be treated 
for his abdominal BCC or hepatitis C, even though he is aware 
that without treatments, these conditions will likely worsen and 
negatively impact his death, namely risk of liver failure, 
invasive cancer, mets, death."

# Health maintenance
Multivitamin with folate, vitamin D, vitamin B12, atorvastatin 
were continued

# Rheumatoid arthritis
His hydroxychloroquine and prednisone 5mg daily were continued.
