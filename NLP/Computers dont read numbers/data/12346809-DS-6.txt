IMAGING: 
CT ABD ___:
1.  Circumferential thickening about the lower esophagus may 
represent mural
thickening from esophagitis versus esophageal varices, but 
assessment is
limited on this non-contrast exam. No pneumomediastinum, fluid 
collection, or
adjacent stranding in the fat planes around the lower esophagus 
to suggest
perforation. Given that the study is limited by the lack of oral 
contrast and
since there is no obvious gross esophageal perforation, further 
assessment
with an esophagram using barium oral contrast could be performed 
if clinical
concern persists in this patient with iodinated contrast 
allergy. 
2.  Fluid in the upper esophagus increases the risk of 
aspiration.
3.  6 mm nodule in the right upper lobe was not present in ___. 
 Follow up in
6 months is recommended with nonenhanced chest CT.

CXR ___:
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality including no definite 
evidence of
pneumomediastinum.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with decompensated NASH cirrhosis, history of non hodgkin's 
lymphoma with liver metastases s/p autologous stem cell 
tranaplant presenting with epigastric pain following endoscopic 
band ligation of esophageal varices.  
 
ACUTE DIAGNOSES: 
#) Epigastric pain: Most likely due to esophageal spasms. 
Improving with IV dilaudid and lidocaine viscous. ACS was ruled 
out based on negative EKG and cardiac enzymes. Non-contrast CT 
did not show any evidence of perforation. PE not concerning for 
crepitus or respiratory distress.  Gastrografin esophagogram was 
entertained but never done since pain improved with bowel rest 
and pain medications. 
  
#) Decompensated NASH cirrhosis c/b varices: s/p prophylactic 
endoscopic band ligation with 5 bands placed. Pt was made NPO 
given risk for perforation. Carafate and omeprazole was 
continued. However, when pain improved and pt reported dyspnea, 
we resumed diuretics at home dose including torsemide and 
spironolactone. Repeat EGD was recommended in 3 weeks.  
   
#) New pulmonary nodule: seen on CT chest on ___ and repeat CT 
in 6 months was recommended. Pt was aware of this finding. She 
has undergone PET scan recently and it was negative for active 
malignancy. Pt to follow up in 6 months.   

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#) DM type II on insulin pump: last A1C 6.9%. Pt on insulin pump 
in addition to metformin at home. ___ consult was obtained 
and recommended reducing basal dose to 2.5 from 3.5 given pt on 
NPO. Metformin was held through hospitalization. 
  
#) Non-hodgkins lymphoma: s/p chemotherapy, autologous 
transplant.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] repeat EGD in ___
[] repeat chest CT in 6 months given new pulmonary nodules 
[] f/u low blood counts, including plt, WBC, anemia 
[] f/u with endocrinologist regarding insulin pump settings

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at the ___ 
___. 

You presented to us with chest pain after undergoing an 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and banding of your esophageal 
varices. We ruled out cardiac causes of chest pain based on 
negative EKG and cardiac enzymes. We ruled out esophageal 
perforation by doing a CT scan of your chest which was negative 
for any evidence of perforation. Thus, we think your chest pain 
was most likely due to spasms after the procedure. Your pain was 
managed with dialudid and lidocaine. We advanced your diet 
further based on your tolerance and appetite. 

Please take your medications as instructed. Please follow up 
with your primary care physician and GI doctors as ___. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
