Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Generalized weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is an ___ with history of peripheral vascular disease 
including abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease 
status post multiple stents, Alzheimer's dementia, and stage 
IIIB limited small-cell lung cancer status post 4 cycles of 
carboplatin/etoposide (cycle 4 completed ___ and radiation 
therapy (last ___ who presents with generalized weakness 
and hypotension. Following polysomnia x2 months and poor oral 
intake x1 month, she was seen by ___ on the day of admission and 
noted to be fatigued, hypotensive (82/56), and mildly 
tachycardic (100). She denied fevers/chills, chest pain, 
cough/shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or dysuria/hematuria. 
Of note, she was admitted recently for weakness and hypotension 
in ___ and found to be orthostatic, likely secondary to 
hypovolemia.  

In the ED, she was afebrile and mildly hypotensive (87/65), but 
fluid-responsive, with resolution of tachycardia. Admission labs 
were notable for chronic stable macrocytic anemia, lactate of 
2.0, elevated BUN:Cr ratio, and negative urinalysis. CTA 
demonstrated stable abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which no 
acute intervention  was advised by vascular surgery in the ED. 
CXR was negative.

shorter. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.
 IntervalsAxes
___
___

CTA abdomen/pelvis (___):
1.  Stable 6.1 x 6.3 cm partially thrombosed infrarenal aortic 
aneurysm with no periaortic inflammatory changes or draping of 
the aorta along the vertebrae to suggest impending rupture. 
Stable focal ectasia of the bilateral common iliac arteries.
2.  Otherwise, unchanged examination.  Osteoblastic lesions in 
L3 and S1 are concerning for metastases.  Previously noted 
hepatic segment V lesion is better seen on prior study.
3.  Stable right adrenal adenoma.
4.  Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.  

Portable CXR (___):
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ with history of peripheral vascular disease 
including abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease 
status post multiple stents, Alzheimer's dementia, and stage 
IIIB limited small-cell lung cancer status post 4 cycles of 
carboplatin/etoposide (cycle 4 completed ___ and radiation 
therapy (last ___ who presents with generalized weakness 
and hypotension.

Active Issues:
(1)Hypotension: Mild hypotension on admission likely reflected 
hypovolemia in the setting of suggestive history of poor oral 
intake, elevated BUN:Cr, and fluid-responsiveness, though 
infection remained a possibility as below. Morning cortisol was 
normal. Hematocrit on admission was consistent with recent 
baseline, and CTA demonstrated stability of known abdominal 
aortic aneurysm. She remained afebrile and hemodynamically 
stable throughout admission on gentle maintenance intravenous 
fluids with improved oral intake. Although she was noted to be 
orthostatic (blood pressure 140s systolic when supine, down to 
100s after standing) despite fluids, she remained asymptomatic 
and was cleared by physical therapy to return home without home 
physical therapy.

(2)Clostridium perfringens bacteremia: Admission blood cultures 
were notable for Clostridium perfringens positivity in ___ 
bottles, with subsequent blood cultures demonstrating no growth 
to date by the time of discharge. Source of transient 
Clostridial bacteremia versus contamination remained unclear in 
the absence of skin breakdown or active gastrointestinal 
illness. Vancomycin was initiated for empiric coverage of gram 
positive rods, with initiation of metronidazole for double 
coverage upon speciation. Vancomycin and metronidazole were 
discontinued in favor of amoxicillin monotherapy (500mg q8h) at 
the suggestion of the infectious disease service, with a planned 
14-day course beginning ___. She remained afebrile and 
hemodynamically stable without leukocytosis throughout 
admission, with the exception of fluid-responsive hypotension on 
admission as above. 

(3)Macrocytic anemia: Hematocrit remained consistent with recent 
baseline at 32-35 throughout admission. Although noted to be 
mildy macrocytic (100-101), B12 and folate levels were normal. 
She remained hemodynamically stable without ischemic symptoms or 
signs of active bleeding throughout admission.

(4)Thrombocytopenia: She remained thrombocytopenic at 120s-140s 
throughout admission, consistent with recent baseline. She 
remained hemodynamically stable without signs of active bleeding 
throughout admission.

Inactive Issues:
(1)Stage IIIB limited small-cell lung cancer: She received no 
active treatment over the course of admission, and close 
oncology follow-up was arranged in the outpatient setting.

(2)Peripheral vascular disease: Abdominal aortic aneurysm was 
noted to be stable on admission CTA, with no acute intervention 
advised by vascular surgery.

(3)Coronary artery disease: She experienced no ischemic 
symptoms, and home simvastatin was continued throughout 
admission.  

(4)Alzheimer's dementia: Home memantine and donepezil were 
continued throughout admission.

Transitional Issues:
- Treatment of orthostasis may be considered in the outpatient 
setting in the event that she becomes symptomatic.
- She was discharged on amoxicillin 500mg PO q8h for possible 
Clostridium perfringens bacteremia, with a planned 14-day course 
beginning ___.
- Pending studies: BCx (___).
- Code status: Full.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking part in your care during your admission 
to ___. As you know, you were 
admitted for low blood pressure likely because you were not 
eating or drinking much, and your blood pressure improved with 
intravenous fluids. It is very important that you remember to 
eat and drink at home so that your blood pressure does not 
become low again. You also were found to have bacteria growing 
in one of your blood cultures and were started on antibiotics, 
which you should continue to take at home.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
