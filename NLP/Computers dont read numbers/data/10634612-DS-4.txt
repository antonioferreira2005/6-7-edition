IMAGING: 
ECHO ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 
25 %) with global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis. 
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber 
size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The 
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate 
(___) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of 
tamponade.  
 
CXR ___: IMPRESSION:  
Cardiac failure with pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural 
effusions.  
 
EKG: Not obtained in ED, on floor in NSR with frequent PVCs

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of recent 
pneumonia, CAD who presents with sudden onset of dyspnea, found 
to have radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema and elevated 
BNP consistent with new onset heart failure.  

# Acute CHF with EF 25%: The most likely etiology of her dyspnea 
is a CHF exacerbation vs. acute presentation given elevated JVD, 
crackles on exam, and elevated BNP. The precipitant of CHF 
exacerbation was unclear and unfortunately no records were 
available in our system. She denies any new medications, 
troponin was normal in the ED. No known valvular disease, though 
again no records available in our system. Arrhythmia is high on 
the differential, particularly as she presented in Afib with RVR 
to the ED. Her history per nursing home notes is notable for 
cardiomyopathy and her current presentation may be progression 
of her underlying cardiac dysfunction. Differential also 
includes an episode of severe hypertension, renal failure, 
hyper/hypothyroidism, PVC induced cardiomyopathy or infectious 
process (pneumonia, UTI). No evidence of pneumonia on CXR but 
she did have UA concerning for UTI so was started on 
ciprofloxacin but discontinued when culture returned negative. 
Patient received lasix 20mg IV on ___, 40mg IV on ___, 40mg IV 
on ___, 40mg IV lasix x 2 on ___ and switched to 40mg PO on 
___. Attempts to contact her PCP were made several times but 
there was no response. Records were requested but only the last 
progress note from PCP was obtained. Per secretary at ___ 
office, there were no records of any cardiac work up including 
echocardiogram or catheterization. Her problem list includes ?MI 
as well as cardiomyopathy. However, patient was not on any 
cardiac meds on arrival. She had an echo which showed overall 
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 
25 %) with global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis, RV 
mild global free wall hypokinesis, Mild to moderate (___) 
mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. It was suggested that patient undergo ischemic 
work up. However, patient declined and insisted on returning to 
nursing home. She was started on atorvastatin 80mg and aspirin 
81mg. She was intermittently hypertensive during admission to 
160s so lisinopril was started at 10mg and uptitrated to 40mg 
daily. She was started on metoprolol. She was discharged on 40mg 
lasix PO daily. She should have daily weights checked and follow 
a low sodium diet. She was admitted on oxygen but weaned off 
before discharge.
   
# Afib with RVR: CHADS2 score= 3. Unclear if this was her first 
episode. ___ have been precipitant of CHF as above vs 
precipitated by CHF exacerbation. Broke with diltiazem in the 
ED. The morning following admission, she went into a fib with 
RVR into 130s-140s sustained with spikes into 170s. She was 
started on metoprolol for rate control. She remained in normal 
sinus rhythm with rates in the 50-60s during admission. She was 
started on coumadin at a dose of 5mg and when INR increased to 
INR now 2.2, decreased dose to 2mg daily. INR returned at 3.8 
___ so held coumadin. Resumed 2mg on ___ and INR increased to 
3.7 on ___ so decreased dose to 1mg daily going forward. She 
should have frequent INR checks at ___ home to determine 
appropriate dose. Continued aspirin 81mg.  

# UTI: Patient presented with dirty UA but asymptomatic. She was 
started on ciprofloxacin but culture returned negative so DCed 
ciprofloxacin.
 
# Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine, TSH wnl
  
# CAD: Continued home aspirin. Started on atorvastatin 80mg. BP 
control with lisinopril and metoprolol.

# Insomnia: Trazodone prn for sleep

# Back pain: received tramadol as needed for pain  

# Code: DNR/DNI  
# Communication: Patient# Emergency Contact: Proxy name: ___ 
___ ___ 
Relationship: Son   - unable to reach during admission, left 
multiple messages

Transitional:
- Patient started on 40mg po lasix daily, please monitor weights 
daily
- Patient started on lisinopril and uptitrated to 40mg daily for 
BP control
- Patient discharged on 75mg metoprolol succinate XL and 
warfarin 1mg daily for Afib
- Please check INR on ___ and adjust warfarin dose as 
needed
- Patient had new diagnoses of systolic heart failure with EF 
25% of unclear etiology. It was suggested that she undergo 
ischemic work up. However, patient declined and insisted on 
returning to nursing home. She will follow up with cardiolgy as 
an outpatient

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for shortness of breath and found to 
have acute congestive heart failure. Your breathing improved 
with diuretic medication. Please continue to take your lasix and 
weigh yourself every day and call you doctor if your weight 
increases by more than 3 lbs or if your shortness of breath 
worsens. The reason for your heart failure is not clear and you 
declined further intervention as you wished to go home. Please 
follow up with your new cardiologist as an outpatient.

You were also noted to occasionally have a rapid irregular heart 
rhythm so you were started on a medication to slow your heart 
rate called metoprolol and a blood thinning medication called 
warfarin to prevent strokes. You will need to have frequent 
blood draws to check your INR, a marker of how the blood thinner 
is working. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
