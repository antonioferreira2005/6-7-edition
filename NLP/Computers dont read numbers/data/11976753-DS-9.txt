Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o nephrolithiasis and Roux-en Y 
choledochojejunostomy presents with left flank pain, N/V, and 
hematuria and evidence of nonobstructive 3mm left kidney stone 
on CT scan.
.  
# right flank pain
Pain distribution and characteristic of renal colic pain ___ 
stones however there is no evidence of symptomatic stones on the 
patient extensive workup and on imaging here. Additionally, 
given full workup at OSH did not seem to account for pain. On 
hospital day 1, Ms. ___ was started on a Dilaudid PCA for 
pain control. An attempt was made to transition to PO pain 
medication on hospital day 2 however she remained in significant 
amount of pain requiring IV dilaudid for breakthrough pain. The 
chronic pain service was eventually consulted. They recommended 
increasing the Duragesic to 100 MCG/hour TTS (to be titrated 
down to her usual 75 MCG/hour dose by her neurologist after 
resolution of exacerbation), to start Tizanidine 4 mg PO TID for 
synergistic analgesia, and to maintain PO dilaudid for 
breakthrough pain.
.
# hematuria
Hematuria resolved after adequate intravenous hydration. It did 
not recur grossly during the hospital course although she still 
had microscopic evidence of it. Urology was curbsided and they 
recommended, in addition to the studies already obtained, urine 
cytology and outpatient cystoscopy. 
.  
# N/V 
Likely secondary to pain although gastroenteritis, pancreatitis, 
hepatitis are all possibilities; lipase wnl so pancreatitis 
unlikely. Transaminases were also normal. She has had a h/o 
elevated alkaline phosphatase and it remained elevated although 
lower than previous values. Scheduled Zofran controlled the 
nausea during Ms. ___ hospitalization.
.  
# hypokalemia/?RTA
Vomiting likely playing a role although she has had a 
long-documented h/o hypokalemia. The hypokalemia was corrected 
with repletion with KCl during her hospitalization. PTH was 
within normal limits. Work-up was deferred for the patient's 
outpatient appointment with a nephrologist in ___. 
.
# anemia
Iron studies revealed that Ms. ___ was Vitamin B12 deficient. 
She was started on Vitamin B12 injections.
.
# Widened mediastinum on xray- Recommended CT chest to further 
evaluate. CT chest showed increase in right paratracheal region 
corresponds to vessels including the right brachiocephalic vein. 
No further w/u was required.
.
# migraines
Fentanyl patch, topamax, and fioricet prn were continued and 
adjusted as above.
