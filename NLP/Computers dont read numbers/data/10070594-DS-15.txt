Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hx of neuroendocrine tumor of unknown origin C1D11 of 
___ who presents from clinic with pancytopenia. 
Pancytopenia was attributed to his recent chemo administration. 
No localizing signs or symptoms of infection or fever, however 
given the patient's neutropenia on admission, patient was 
started on cipro prophylaxis and was maintained on neutropenic 
precautions. Due to fatigue and a hemoglobin of 7.2, patient was 
transfused with 1u prbc on ___, with symptomatic improvement. 
Hgb responded appropriately, and remained stable 
post-transfusion. WBC count improved during admission, as well, 
and patient was discharged with ANC of 2300 (was 0 on 
admission). Thromboycytopenia was 60 on admission, and initially 
declined during admission to nadir of 20, but was rising at the 
time of discharge (24). Patient was on apixaban for 
anticoagulation in the setting of a recent PICC-associated DVT 
as well as atrial fibrillation, which was transitioned to 
lovenox upon admission (though was discontinued when platelets 
fell below 50). Patient's labs should be closely monitored, and 
anticoagulation should be resumed when platelets rise. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Please draw CBC with diff on ___
- Patient's anticoagulation was held at the time of discharge 
given thrombocytopenia. When platelets >50, consider resuming 
lovenox vs apixaban (depending on if DVT attributed to 
malignancy or PICC, as well as patient preference).
- Cipro prophylaxis was discontinued at the time of discharge, 
as the patient is no longer neutropenic. 
- Allopurinol was changed to 200mg daily given renal function
- Lasix held during admission, as he was clinically dry, and his 
weight has been declining. Was not resumed at the time of 
discharge. Consider resuming, as clinically indicated.
