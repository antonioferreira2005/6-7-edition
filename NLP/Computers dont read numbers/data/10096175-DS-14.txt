Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ presents for elective clipping of the left MCA 
aneurysm. 

#L MCA aneurysm
She was taken to the OR on ___ and underwent left craniotomy 
for aneurysm clipping with Dr. ___. The procedure was 
uncomplicated. Please see separately dictated operative report 
by Dr. ___ complete details of the procedure. She 
tolerated the procedure well. She was extubated in the OR and 
transferred to PACU for recovery. She remained neurologically 
stable and was transferred to the neuro step-down unit for close 
monitoring. She was cleared to resume home Aspirin on POD#7. Per 
discussion with her PCP's office, Plavix is no longer needed and 
can be discontinued. 

#Seizures/epilepsy 
She takes Lamotrigine at home for h/o seizures. On POD#2 (___) 
she had 3 episodes of unresponsiveness with oxygen desaturations 
to the ___, lasting about 1 minute. She received 0.5mg Ativan to 
break the seizure, however her exam remained altered with 
aphasia after unresponsiveness and oxygen improved with 
supplemental oxygen. Head CT was stable with postop changes but 
no acute complication. EEG was placed and captured seizure 
activity which correlated with unresponsiveness. She was loaded 
with 2g keppra then 1500mg bid and her lamictal 150mg BID was 
continued. Her mental status remained altered. Neurology consult 
was placed for additional AED recommendations and EEG was 
placed, which was positive for seizure activity. On ___, she 
became acutely agitated and received 0.5mg Ativan and 0.25mg 
Haldol, however this agitation was unrelated to seizure. On ___, 
EEG was read as generalized slowing with frequent epileptiform 
discharges in temporal region (L > R), without overt seizure 
activity.

#COPD/Respiratory distress
She was initially continued on her home COPD inhaler medications 
without issue. However, during the episode of agitation on ___, 
she was tachypneic and in respiratory distress, for which ___ 
was consulted. She was also febrile to 102 and her SpO2 was 92% 
on RA. A CXR showed mild-moderate pulmonary edema, ABG showed 
PaO2 of 60. She was started on face mask with 50% FiO2, given 
20mg IV Lasix, and started on broad spectrum antibiotics to 
cover for pneumonia. She was transferred to Neuro ICU for 
complicated respiratory status. In the ICU, she was redosed with 
20mg IV Lasix, which was continued BID, and she was weaned to 2L 
NC. 

#Fever
She was initially started on vancomycin and zosyn when found to 
be febrile on ___, and it was determined that she should 
complete a 7 day course of antibiotics. She was transitioned to 
___ugmentin on ___.
