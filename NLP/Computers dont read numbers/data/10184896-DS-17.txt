IMAGING:
___ CT ABD/PELVIS W/ CONTRAST:
1) Multiple dilated loops of small bowel in the right lower 
quadrant with air fluid levels and fecalization of small bowel 
loops. Regional mesenteric stranding/small amount of fluid. No 
definite transition point identified, although focal narrowing 
as above. Findings are potentially from a partial or early small 
bowel obstruction.  
2. A focal area of small bowel narrowing with wall thickening 
could be a 
focal stricture. This however, does not explain dilated loops 
distally. 
3) Hepatic steatosis. 
.
___ KUB:
IMPRESSION: Dilated loops of small bowel in the right lower 
quadrant with 
air-fluid levels suggestive of partial or early small-bowel 
obstruction.
