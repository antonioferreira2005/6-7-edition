FINDINGS: 
 
Bilateral lower extremity has saphenous vein mapping was

Right:
Because of of lower leg bandage at the small saphenous and 
lowest portion of the greater saphenous were not imaged.  The 
greater saphenous vein from upper calf to the knee he measures 
2.7, 3.2, 3.2 mm.  The knee to groin diameters are 3.9, 4.3,

Left:
The left greater saphenous vein is patent with small diameters 
below the knee and an area of thickening ___ the calf. These 
diameters range from 1.1- 2.4 mm. The need to groin diameters 
with the vein quality is better are 3.2, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 mm. The

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT - Final  Date Specimen(s) Received: 
___ 
1. Bone, medial calcaneus right foot, debridement:
- Acute osteomyelitis.
2. Bone and soft tissue, lateral calcaneus right foot, 
debridement:

tissue formation, and inflammatory fibrinous exudate.
- Scant fragments of bone.
3. Bone, post-debridement calcaneus right foot, excision:
- Acute osteomyelitis.
- Fibroconnective tissue with acute and chronic inflammation and 
degenerative changes.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with T1DM and chronic non-healing right foot 
wounds presented with increased drainage from right heel wound, 
concerning for wound infection and osteomyelitis with exposed 
bone. He was initially admitted to the medical service, then 
transferred to the VICU following a debridement on ___ and 
angiogram on ___.

# Osteomyelitis of Right Heel
Presumed osteomyelitis initially given exposed bone with 
drainage on physical exam. Patient was take to the OR on ___ by 
Plastics Surgery for debridement with tissues sent for biopsy 
and pathology. Microbiology eventually showed growth of MRSA. He 
was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole after for 
empiric treatment of a diabetic foot wound ___ preparation for a 
bypass procedure. He was subsequently narrowed to vancomycin and 
PO ciprofloxacin for a planned ___y ID. Repeat bone 
cultures taken from his washout and debridement on ___ grew 
VRE, so his vancomycin was discontinued and switched to 
daptomycin. A baseline CK level was checked ___ preparation for 
weekly monitoring. 

#Peripheral vascular disease
___ addition, patient had been previously planned for an 
angiogram on ___, which was performed. Given his distal disease, 
it was felt he would benefit from a bypass, so vein mapping was 
performed, and he underwent a below-knee popliteal to plantar 
artery bypass on ___. He was then transferred to the VICU 
where he stayed for the remainder of his hospitalization. He was 
started on plavix post-operatively on POD#1.

#Right heel wound
Plastic surgery was consulted for his right heel wound, which 
was debrided on ___, and OR planning was started for a 
coverage procedure following revascularization. His initial bone 
biopsies returned positive for MRSA, so he was taken back to the 
OR on ___ with Orthopedics for further calcaneal I&D.

#Delirium post-op
Following his bypass, the patient was mildly delirious, so his 
insulin pump was held. By POD#___nd POD#3 after 
his second bone debridement he appeared to be mentating at his 
baseline level.

# Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus
Last HbA1c 7.4% ___ ___. Complicated by neuropathy, 
retinopathy, and PVD. Uses an insulin pump. He continued his 
insulin pump with ___ Diabetes consult for co-management 
while inpatient. The pump was discontinued pre-operatively and 
restarted on POD#5 following his bypass, with Lantus and a 
Humalog sliding scale given while the pump was off. On 
restarting, however, throughout the day he was inappropriately 
dosing himself and had incorrectly attached his insulin pump. He 
was asymptomatic, however his blood glucose levels rose to the 
400s, he had (+) ketones ___ his urine his anion gap widened to 
24. Labs were rechecked periodically overnight and his gap had 
closed by morning with SC insulin only. ___ conjunction with 
___, the decision was made to maintain him on Lantus and a 
sliding scale for the time being, with plans to re-evaluate him 
as a pump candidate as an outpatient.

___
He was evaluated by physical therapy, who felt he would benefit 
from discharge to acute rehab.

Following surgery, he did well with no hemodynamic instability 
and no evidence of loss of patency of his graft. At the time of 
discharge, he was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs. 
He was tolerating a regular diet, out of bed as tolerated with 
___, voiding without assistance, and his pain was well controlled 
on oral medications. He was deemed ready for discharge, and was 
given the appropriate discharge and follow-up instructions. Mr. 
___ was discharged to rehab on ___ ___ good condition.
