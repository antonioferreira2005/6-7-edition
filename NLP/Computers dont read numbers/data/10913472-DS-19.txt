Epi-<1 TransE-___ yo woman with past medical history of COPD with continued 
tobacco use and history of previous intubation, h/o Legionaires 
Disease, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia presents from OSH 
with hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration found 
to have severe R-sided MRSA pneumonia, bacteremia, and 
endocarditis.

# MRSA pneumonia: likely aspiration ___ the setting of witnessed 
vomiting at OSH. Patient was intubated at OSH on ___ and 
successfully extubated at ___ on ___. Patient was initially 
covered broadly with vanc, aztreonam (given pcn allergy), 
flagyl, and azithromycin. When sputum cx indicated MRSA, 
antibiotics were narrowed to vancomycin. Blood cultures from ___ 
also indicated MRSA bacteremia. Patient is to be continued on 
vancomycin for a 4 week course from first negative blood 
cultures (day 1: ___. TTE with suboptimal imaging and no 
evidence of definitive vegetations. Pt has severe R > L MRSA 
pneumonia w/ small cavitary lesions on lungs. Pt was 
successfully extubated ___ and reportedly had O2 sat 93-96% 
on 3L. Pt was previously on vancomycin and clindamycin, but 
clindamycin was discontinued on ___. Pt continues to have 
MRSA ___ sputum cultures as recently as ___. Vancomycin 
trough elevated at 33 at dosage of 1g iv q12h. Dosage was 
adjusted to vancomycin 1g iv q24, which was low and vancomycin 
increased to 1g iv q12h on day of discharge. Pt will need 6 week 
course from first negative blood culture (___), ending ___ 
given endocarditis (see below). Pt will need a repeat vancomycin 
level on ___ drawn at 7AM (30 minutes prior to AM 
dose). Pt's goal vancomycin trough is ___. Her vancomycin 
dosing may need to be adjusted to maintain this level. Please 
draw CBC with differential, BUN, Cr, AST, ALT, and vancomycin 
trough on ___ and then every week on ___ and fax results 
to ___ ___ ID nurses). ICD9 424.90 Endocarditis, 
___ MRSA pneumonia. Her oxygen should be weaned as tolerated 
(baseline O2 sat likely 92% due to COPD).

# MRSA bacteremia, endocarditis: Pt had one blood culture 
positive for MRSA on ___. Multiple blood cultures since then 
have been negative. Pt does have murmur on exam, which she 
reports has been known since ___ but not investigated. Given 
MRSA bacteremia, concern for possible endocarditis. TTE showed 
no evidence of definitive vegetations, but with suboptimal 
windows. TEE on ___ showed a "very small" aortic valve 
vegetation. Pt's treatment course therefore extended to 6 weeks 
after last negative blood culture (___).

# electrolyte abnormalities: Pt had derangements ___ her 
electrolytes with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia. 
Most likely due to massive diuresis. PTH normal. Vitamin D level 
low at 16. Pt was given vitamin D 50,000 units x 2 during this 
admission and started on 1000 units daily. Pt also required 
large amounts of repletion of potassium (oral), calcium (IV), 
and magnesium (IV). Her urine output has stabilized, so she is 
less likely to have electrolyte derangements, but would 
recommend checking potassium, calcium, and magnesium on ___ and 
repleting as necessary. Pt is currently on standing calcium 
1000mg po TID, which may be tapered if she no longer requires 
calcium repletion.

# Septic Shock: resolved. Secondary to MRSA pneumonia and high 
grade bacteremia. Patient required 2 pressors on admit (neo and 
levo) and was also placed on sodium carbonate drip given severe 
acidosis with pH 6.97. She had been started on stress dose 
steroids at OSH which was continued but tapered over her 
hospital course.

# Anemia: Normocytic. Pt had anemia throughout hospital stay. 
DIC labs were negative. Likely secondary to anemia of chronic 
disease and iatrogenic secondary to numerous blood draws. 
Patient initially had coffee ground NGT output on admit. EGD on 
___ had no evidence of clean based ulcers thought to secondary 
to NGT with no evidence of active bleeding. Pt was given 2 x 
pRBC transfusion on ___. 24 hour NGT holiday initiated. No 
further coffee ground NGT output. Patient was transitioned from 
IV protonix to po pantoprazole 40mg po BID, which she should 
continue for at least 2 months, then taper to 40mg po daily for 
___ months. Retic count is high, iron is low, ferritin is high, 
transferrin low so suggestive of combination of iron deficiency 
and anemia of chronic disease. Haptoglobin is high, so no 
evidence of hemolysis. Stool guaiac negative on ___. She was 
given 1 x pRBC on ___. Pt also received ferric gluconate 
125mg iv x 1 on ___. Discharge Hct 24.8, which is 
up-trending. She was started on oral iron supplementation along 
with increased bowel regimen given her prior history of 
constipation.

# massive edema, fluid overload: resolved. Pt was reportedly 
transferred to ___ after having received 8L fluids, and while 
___ ___ MICU over 12 days, Pt's net fluid balance was positive 
5.7L, for a total of 13.7L over 14 days. Pt had diuresis over 
several days with massive output of ___ with furosemide 20mg iv 
___ daily. Her edema has completely resolved and is felt to be 
euvolemic. proBNP initially 5345, now proBNP 1428. Pt was not 
discharged with any diuretics.

# Biliary obstruction/gallstones: resolved. Initially felt to be 
cholestasis of sepsis, with RUQ showing gallbladder with sludge 
and stones, no wall thickening but there is surrounding fluid, 
gallbladder enlarged (5cm)compared to CT on ___, CBD dilated 
8mm, pancreatic duct dilated 4mm. Per ERCP, likely 
choledocholithiasis w/o cholangitis or pancreatitis with known 
gallstones. Pt's LFTs have normalized.

# weakness: Pt had marked weakness ___ her extremities. Most 
likely due to combination of deconditioning from her long 
hospitalization and possibly ICU myopathy. Also compounded by 
severe fluid overload and edema. Weakness has improved markedly 
with diuresis, which is complete, and physical and occupational 
therapy, which she will need to continue at ___.

# h/o HIT, DVT prophylaxis: Heparin contraindicated for DVT 
prophylaxis. Further anticoagulation was held ___ the setting of 
sepsis and severe illness. As patient began to clinically 
improve and CVVHD was discontinued, patient was to be started on 
half dose fondaparinux per hematology recommendations but 
patient refused. She was advised of the risks of not receiving 
anticoagulation especially with her prolonged immobilization. 
Pneumoboot remained on left leg throughout hospital stay. 
Patient requested that outpatient hematologist be contacted 
prior to beginning fondaparinux. She was reassured the 
outpatient hematologist agreed with administration of 
fondaparinux. Her current dose of fondaparinux is 2.5 mg SC 
DAILY, which she should continue as long as her mobility remains 
below her baseline.

# Metabolic disturbances, hyperkalemia and acidosis: resolved. 
Potassium peaked to 6.8 at OSH with EKG changes of peaked T 
waves. Likely secondary to extracellular shift of potassium
