WITH SKIN
      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.

PERTINENT IMAGING/STUDIES:
==========================
___ CXR: Increased left lower lobe opacity, worrisome for 
pneumonia with possible associated left pleural effusion. 
Aspiration is also in the differential diagnosis.
 Reticular right base opacity could be due to chronic 
aspiration, and is
slightly decreased as compared to the prior study.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___. is an ___ male with PMH of progressive 
Alzheimer's dementia who presented from SNF with fever, altered 
mental status, cough and emesis. He had already been empirically 
started with levofloxacin at his nursing facility but given 
increasing lethargy, he was transferred to ___ for further 
management.

ACUTE ISSUES:
===============================
# Pneumonia: His presenting symptoms of fever, altered mental 
status, and confusion were likely related to a pneumonia as 
confirmed by CXR. There was high suspicion for aspiration 
pneumonia in setting of Alzheimer's and recent emesis. Swallow 
team was consulted and found no overt signs or symptoms of 
aspiration, and he was kept on his prior to admission diet. He 
was maintained on his outpatient antibiotic regimen 
(levofloxacin), and his presenting leukocytosis seems to be 
responding to antibiotics. His family noted that he was at 
baseline mental status prior to discharge. On levofloxacin 
antibiotic regimen (start date ___ complete date ___.

#Hypernatremia: Patient was found to have a sodium of 150 mEq/L 
on ___. Started on D5W 1000 mL at 100 mL/hr. Corrected from 150 
mEq/L to 145 mEq/L on discharge.

# Progressive alzhemier's dementia: Patient's dementia seems to 
have worsened significantly over last 6 months. Per family, 
patient was independent and verbal in ___ but has 
become increasingly nonverbal over last 6 months. In the week 
preceding admissionften does not respond. He enjoys reading and 
still reads articles. He was maintained on outpatient 
Cyanocobalamin 500 mcg PO DAILY and Donepezil 5 mg PO QHS. 

# Malnutrition: Patient has poor oral intake and is not meeting 
nutritional goals. At nursing facility he eats pureed foods and 
thickened liquids, which was continued during this 
hospitalization alongside supplemental Ensure Enlive and 
multivitamin with minerals. Per swallow team, he retains a lot 
of food in his mouth after meals, so it is important to ensure 
mouth cleared at end of each meal.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
========================================
#Elevated alkaline phosphate: Alk phos was elevated to 286 upon 
admission without elevation of other liver enzymes. Of note, it 
was previously elevated to 187 during last admission as well in 
___. It is likely bone origin given lack of transaminitis and 
patient's history of hyperparathyroidism. His Ca level was 10.2 
on ___ per outside records. No further management during this 
hospitalization.

# CAD: Patient has a history of coronary artery disease, s/p LCx 
DES ___. His most recent echocardiogram in ___ shows 
mild LVH, LVEF >=55%, mildly dilated ascending aorta (3.6 cm), 
1+TR, and normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure. He was 
maintained on outpatient aspirin 81mg daily.

# Pituitary adenoma: CT from ___ showed persistent expansion 
of the sella with soft tissue consistent with patient's 
previously diagnosed pituitary macroadenoma. Not actively 
managed during hospitalization.

#Constipation: Patient did not have any issues with bowel 
movements during admission and was maintained on outpatient 
bowel regimen of Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID, Senna 8.6, and 
Polyethylene Glycol 17 g PO/NG DAILY 

==================================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==================================
[ ] Patient should complete 7-day course of levofloxacin on 
___.
[ ] Follow up sodium in ___ days and increase PO free water if 
mildly rising. If markedly rising, consider D5W infusion if able 
or transfer for management of hypernatremia if within patient's 
goals of care.
[ ] Per swallow team, he retains a lot of food in his mouth 
after meals, so it is important to ensure mouth cleared at end 
of each meal.

Na at discharge: 145
