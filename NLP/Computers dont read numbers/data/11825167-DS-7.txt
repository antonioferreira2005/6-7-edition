was admitted with acute on chronic abdominal pain. 

# Abdominal pain: This was similar to prior episodes that in the 
past have been attributed to gastritis/GERD. Labs were notable 
for an elevated lipase of 293 so pancreatitis was considered. In 
early ___, he had a CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast that 
demonstrated no acute intra-abdominal abnormalities. In early 
___, he also had an EGD that demonstrated mucosa suggestive of 
___ esophagus (biopsy) and a small sessile polyp at the 
distal esophagus. He reported having an unremarkable colonoscopy 
- report not available for my review. He was treated with bowel 
rest, acid suppressing therapy, and pain control. We discussed 
that ___ may be useful to evaluate for structural abnormality 
given elevated lipase and concern for pancareatitis. Certainly 
he should follow up with hepatology/GI for further evaluation as 
well for management of his cirrhosis. His symptoms were 
improving at the time of discharge. 

#EtOH cirrhosis/?Hep C: No signs of decompensation. Discussed 
importance of follow up with hepatology. 

#Left iliac lesion: During recent hospitalization noted to have 
mixed lucent and sclerotic lesion in the left iliac bone 
measuring up to 2.9-cm. Will need additional imaging as an 
outpatient unless long term stability can be confirmed.

considering arranging IV iron infusions.

CHRONIC:

#HTN: Continue enalapril
#DM2: Continue home meds and on sliding scale insulin while 
hospitalized.
#Bipolar disorder: Continue sertraline, seroquel, and ativan. He 
reported that OSH physician recently stopped valium and 
increased dose of ativan. 
#Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine
