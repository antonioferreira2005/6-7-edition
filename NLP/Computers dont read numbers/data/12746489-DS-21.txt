IMAGING:
Barium esophagram ___: 
Examination limited by patient positioning. Patulous mid and 
distal esophagus with poor peristaltic motion, resulting in 
moderate delay of passage into the stomach. Mild narrowing at 
the gastroesophageal junction. No obvious mass, however, given 
the limited scope of this examination, direct visualization with 
endoscopy could be considered to exclude an obstructing lesion. 

CXR ___:
Mild cardiomegaly has improved and pulmonary vascular 
engorgement has nearly cleared and previous substantial pleural 
effusions have resolved since ___. The lower esophagus is 
moderately distended with air.  There is no pneumomediastinum, 
pneumothorax, or appreciable pleural effusion. Lungs are grossly 
clear. 

GI ENDOSCOPY:
EGD ___: 
A foreign body with the appearance of a plastic cap was found in 
the esophagus. We cannot bypass the foreign object, even with an 
pedi-scope. Not knowing what his object was coming from, and 
whether it could have been related with a medical device, we did 
not remove the foreign object.
Otherwise normal EGD to middle third of the esophagus 

EGD ___: 
Severe esophagitis was seen in distal esophagus. Bottle cap 
lodged in distal esophagus was removed with forceps in an 
uncomplicated fashion. Trachealization was seen of 
mid-esophagus. No biopsies were taken during this endoscopy. 
Erythema and friability were seen throughout entire stomach 
compatible with gastritis. Normal mucosa in the duodenum. 
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: Mr. ___ is a ___ M w/ DM type II, 
debilitating chronic back pain and hx esophageal cancer s/p 
resection/chemoXRT ___ who presented with dysphagia and 
vomiting, now s/p endoscopic removal of obstructing bottle cap 
on ___. 

# Dysphagia due to foreign body ingestion: Difficulty swallowing 
solids, and intermittently liquids for week prior to admission 
with vomiting upon intake of food. Symptoms began after 
discharge from ___ where patient was observed having a seizure. 
patient was discharged to rehab. Barium esophagram in ED showed 
patulous mid and distal esophagus with poor peristaltic motion, 
resulting in moderate delay of passage into the stomach w/ mild 
narrowing at the gastroesophageal junction. EGD on ___ showed 
foreign body of a plastic bottlecap. EGD on ___ successfully 
removed bottlecap and showed extensive esophagitis. Patient was 
kept on sips initially, then NPO for the endoscopic procedures. 
After removal of the bottlecap, patient was started on clear 
liquids and advanced to soft solids, and all his PO meds were 
restarted. He reports that his symptoms have resolved with 
removal of the bottlecap.
With extensive esophagitis and gastritis seen on EGD, patient 
was started on 1gm sucralflate QID. He will also continue 40mg 
pantoprazole daily. He will followup with Dr. ___ in 8 weeks 
for endoscopic biopsies. 
- STARTED sucralfate
