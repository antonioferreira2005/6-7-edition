Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

 
History of Present Illness:
___ with chronic abdominal ___ on a number of medications, on 
TPN and home IV hydration who presents with syncope/hypotension.

She has had multiple admission in the ___ system including a 
recent admission from ___ to ___. During that 
admission, she was seen for acute on chronic abdominal ___, 
hypotension/palpitations, syncope, and nutritional issues (and 
others). ___ management was consulted and changed her 
medications with the addition of muscle relaxant medications. 
She was not tolerant of PO food or drink due to worsening ___ 
and nausea. She experienced intermittent hypotension and 
bradycardia and per report was asymptomatic and thought to be 
secondary to her medication regimen. She was placed on TPN 
during this admission at the request of her outpatient GI 
physician. However, the patient refused to take in more then 800 
calories. She was discharged home.

She states since discharge she has been lightheaded and "passed 
out" ___ times. Her blood pressures have been in the 70/40 to 
80/40s for the past 5 days. The day prior to presentation, she 
"passed out" and fell with resultant whole body ___. The day of 
presentation, she noted feeling very lightheaded and weak and 
reports a blood pressure of ___. EMS was called. She was 
found to have a systolic BP in ___ and was brought to hospital. 

Of note, she reports she has not been taking in PO food. The 
only food she can tolerate is her mothers "baked potatoes" and 
some ice cream. She has not been taking a number of her 
medications because it causes her to have stomach ___. She also 
notes that a number of her medications cause her to pass out 
including tizanidine. However, she will not down titrate or stop 
that medication because it has some benefit for her abdominal 
___.

Also of note, she is on a number of medications from the ___ 
center and from her outpatient GI physician, which she considers 
essential. She is unwilling to change her home regimen. Also, 
she is unwilling to take more than 800 calories of TPN. She was 
very upset at a 6 pound weight gain at home (although per our 
records show that she has lost weight).

Upon presentation to the ED, initial vitals were: T 98.4, HR 70, 
BP 83/32, RR 18, SvO2 99% RA. WBC was 14. Phos was 2.2. Chem 7 
was normal. CXR was normal. UA was negative for infection. Blood 
cx pending. Lactate was normal. She was given 1L IVF in the ED 
with improved blood pressures to 118/69. She was admitted to 
medicine for further evaluation and management.

Currently, she feels improved with the IV fluids. She notes 
chronic abdominal ___ and nausea. She does not currently feel 
lightheaded. She endorses joint ___ in "all of them".

ROS: per above. She denies headache, chest ___, palpitations, 
shortness of breath, vomiting, constipation, numbness, vision 
changes, dysuria, cough, rash, sinus congestion or other 
symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with chronic abdominal ___ on a many medications, on TPN 
with home hydration, who presents with syncope and hypotension.

Active Issues:
# Hypotension:
# Orthostatic hypotension:
# Syncope/Presyncope:
# Sinus bradycardia:
The causes of the hypotension and syncope/presyncope are 
multifactorial. Initially she had evidence of dehydration and 
her blood pressures improved with IV fluids. However, after 
aggressive resuscitation and euvolemia, she still had a 40 point 
systolic drop from supine to standing. At least some of the 
issue is secondary to deconditioning from a largely sedentary 
and supine lifestyle. She was recommended to use waist high 
stockings and as much ambulation as possible for autonomic 
training. Finally, a major contributing factor was felt to be 
medication, including tizanidine. Throughout her 
hospitalization, she triggered mulitple times for hypotension 
and somnolence, generally after receiving tizanidine. 
Ultimately, after multiple discussions with the patient, her 
tizanidine was titrated down (eventually from 12 mg TID to 6,4,6 
mg TID). Her BP and heart rate largely normalized with this 
change. I strongly recommend further downtitration of this 
medication however she is very resistant as it is one of the few 
medications to improve her abdominal ___. A ___ stim test was 
normal. Given continue relative hypotension, she was started on 
0.1mg of florinef daily with improvement in her blood pressures. 
At the time of discharge, her systolic blood pressure range was 
upper ___ to 130s. She was asymptomatic with position change and 
walking. She did not have further episodes of presyncope or 
syncope. She did endorse some fatigue which she attributed to 
blood pressure. I discussed the need for further downtitration 
of her medications with the patient and father. If she has 
worsening blood pressure, increase in florinef can be 
considered.

# Dehydration:
She gets IV hydration at home. She was on 1 L NS per day. 
However, she was not taking in any PO and had low UOP.  
Throughout hospitalization here, she was generally maintained on 
___ L per day. She was encouraged to increase her PO fluid 
intake; however, she was reluctant to do this, as she reports 
that this increases her abdominal ___.  Ultimately, it was 
decided that she will need to continue her IVF at home with a 
plan for 2L NS per day. We discussed the need to increase her PO 
intake and decrease her home dependence on IV resuscitation. At 
the time of discharge she was taking in some PO fluids.

# Moderate Malnutrition:
She was continued on TPN initially. On admission, she would not 
allow for more than 800 calories per day. She was not taking PO 
food or drink. This certainly was not ideal nutrition for the 
patient and the reasoning behind this was unclear but does 
involve fear of weight gain. After lengthy multidisciplinary 
meeting where risks of long-term TPN were explained, the patient 
became agreeable to trying to get off of TPN. She slowly was 
able to advance her diet to a point that she was able to take in 
enough calories that she was weaned off of TPN. She required 
significant encouragement to maintain adequate calories. She was 
discharged without TPN. Her PICC was removed.

# Abdominal ___:
# Nausea:
She is on a polypharmacy regimen, including non FDA approproved 
medications (domperidone). Of note, the etiology of her ___ is 
visceral hypersensitivity syndrome. She also notes a number of 
other diagnoses such as narcotic bowel, crohn's disease, IBS. 
Dr. ___ ___ has been following. It was also felt that there 
was a large psychiatric component to the patient's ___. Given 
concerns about risks of her ___ regimen (hypotension, 
sedation), we adjusted her ___ regimen including decreasing the 
tizanidine, increasing nucynta 50mg TID and starting remeron 
(for ___ and depression). A trial of flexeril was unsuccessful. 
She was discharged with GI and ___ clinic follow up.

# PTSD:
# Anxiety state (patient denies):
# Depression:
The patient was continued on her home regimen. Remeron was 
added. Dr. ___ is her provider and has been following her in 
the hospital. It seems as though she is decompensated from a 
mental standpoint but it is unclear how much of this is the 
cause (or is causing) her ___ symptoms. She takes propranolol 
at night for night terrors. 

# Insomnia:
She is on many medications for her ___ regimen. She was 
discontinued from trazodone. Her ambien CR was discontinued but 
was then restarted. Her clonazepam was titrated down as well. 
Remeron was added which may help her insomnia. Also, it was 
encouraged that she wean down the Tylenol ___ but she has been 
resistant to this idea thus far.

# Bradycardia:
The likely cause is tizanidine. After the decrease of 
tizanidine, her bradycardia symptoms improved. We continued 
propranolol with holding orders.

# Anemia:
Presumably this is nutritional. It has been low in the past as 
well. We will trend for now.

She is full code but does not want CPR to last more than 10 
minutes. Also, if she is found pulseless, with an unknown time 
of pulselessness, she does not want to be resuscitated.

Transitional issues:
- continued down titration of ___ regimen
- encouragement of PO, hopefully able to discontinue IVF and 
florinef
- continued psychiatric evaluation and treatment
- ___, family supervision, and ___ evaluation

She is at high risk of readmission. This is in part due to the 
psychiatric component of her disease. Until this is 
optimized/fully treated she may continue to have medical 
exacerbations. Per report, she has been noncompliant with her 
medication regimen in the past (she self manages and has a 
number of medications at home). If she adjusts dose of her home 
medications (eg tizanidine) she could have worsening of her 
hypotensive and bradycardic symptoms. At the the time of 
discharge her symptoms were greatly improved (she was without 
presyncope and was able to ambulate and change positions without 
problems) and her medication regimen was improved. However, she 
needs further titration of her regimen as an outpatient. I 
strongly recommend attempting to wean as many medications as 
possible. She has very close follow up with her PCP and ___ 
clinic is being scheduled. She also has ___, ___ and social 
support. She is well aware of symptoms for which to contact her 
PCP or to ___ to the emergency department. She was 
enrolled in the PACT program for additional support. All of this 
was discussed with the patient and her father.
