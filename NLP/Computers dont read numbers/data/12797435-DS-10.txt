Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.  

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:  

1. ___ consult for med co-management

2. urinary retension - straight cath x 1

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by 
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1. The patient 
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of 
POD#1. The foley was removed on POD#2.  He initially failed the 
void trial and was straight cathed x 1 and the patient was 
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was 
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean 
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient 
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout 
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well. The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.  

At time of discharge, patient was deemed stable for safe 
discharge to rehab.  

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with posterior hip 
precautions.
