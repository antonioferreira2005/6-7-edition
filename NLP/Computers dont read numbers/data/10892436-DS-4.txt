___ Carotid U/S: Findings as stated above which indicate no 
significant ICA stenosis bilaterally (graded as less than 40% 
bilaterally).
.
___ Echo: PRE-BYPASS: Limited exam due to pt's history of 
gastric banding. Upper and mid-esophageal views only. No 
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left 
atrium. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The 
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal 
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve 
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is critical aortic 
valve stenosis (valve area 0.7cm2 by planimetry)). The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Post-Bypass: Pt is being AV-paced and is 
on a phenylephrine infusion. Global LV and RV function remains 
unchanged. There is a well seated 21mm ___ bioprosthetic 
valve in place. There is no perivalvular leak. Residual 
gradients unable to be obtained. Other valvular structures
