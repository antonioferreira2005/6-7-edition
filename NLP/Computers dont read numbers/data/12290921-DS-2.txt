stenosis on either side. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ male with a history of HIV (CD4 
653, VL undetectable), T2DM (a1c 5.9) and CKD (creatinine 1.85) 
who presents for evaluation of recurrent mechanical falls versus 
syncope, episodes of confusion and worsening renal failure.

#) Recurrent mechanical falls:
Falls likely secondary to mechanical falls secondary to sensory 
deficits and unsteady gait. The patient was also found to have 
orthostatic hypotension, which could have contributed to his 
unsteady gait as well. Cardiac processes, including arrhythmia, 
MI, and valvular disease were ruled out as the patient had no 
events on telemetry, troponins <0.01 x2, no EKG changes, and 
echo did not reveal any valvular disease. Neurologic processes 
were ruled out with negative CT head and carotid ultrasound.  
The patient was evaluated by physical therapy, who observed poor 
gait. The patient will be discharged to rehab for further 
functional mobility training, gait training, and endurance 
training. 

# Right ___ fracture:
Patient sustained a right ___ fracture s/p fall. The patient 
was seen by orthopedics and his fracture was reduced. 
Unfortunately, in the setting of delirium, the patient pulled 
off his cast twice, requiring repeat reduction each time. 
Subsequent x-rays showed a greater degree of impaction and 
dorsal angulation. As the patient continued to remove his cast, 
orthopedics placed the patient's right arm in a splint. He was 
also started on vitamin C, D, and calcium for bone health. The 
patient will follow up with orthopedics as an outpatient. He 
should avoid weight bearing at the wrist. He can bear weight at 
the elbow. The patient was counseled to avoid NSAIDs due to 
chronic kidney disease. His pain can be managed with tylenol. 

#) Acute on chronic kidney disease:
Patient has a history of chronic kidney disease with a baseline 
creatinine of 1.85. On presentation, creatinine was elevated to 
2.5. Patient denied any decreased fluid intake. Urine 
electrolytes were consistent with prerenal etiology. Renal 
ultrasound was negative for an obstructive etiology. His kidney 
function rapidly improved with IV fluids and returned below 
baseline at the time of discharge. 

#) Delirium:
The patient became confused and delirious on day 2 of 
hospitalization. As the patient was at his baseline initially, 
the cause of his acute delirium was thought to be due to his 
hospitalization and being in an unfamiliar situation. Per HCP, 
the patient is independent and organized at baseline. Geriatrics 
and psychiatry were consulted for management of delirium. The 
patient was started on seroquel 12.5mg BID with PRNs for 
agitation. The patient developed a drug rash 1 day after 
starting seroquel. As the patient's delirium was resolving, 
psychiatry recommended zyprexa 2.5mg PRN for agitation. Serial 
EKGs were checked, his QTc ranged from 450-460. 

#) ? Dementia:
The patient reports two recent events where he has become 
confused and lost his way in familiar environments. His health 
care proxy was able to verify this. CT head was negative and 
admission neuro exam was nonfocal. As the patient became 
delirious on day 2 of hospitalization, it was difficult to 
further evaluate for dementia. TSH and B12 were negative. RPR 
was also negative. DDx includes Alzheimer's disease, 
microvascular disease, and HIV encephalopathy. The patient will 
require further workup including neuropsychiatric testing and 
possible MRI as an outpatient. 

#) HTN: 
The patient was found to be orthostatic and symptomatic on 
admission. Therefore valsartan was discontinued. He remained 
normotensive. Consider restarting valsartan should he become 
hypertensive. 

#) Hyperlipidemia
Mr. ___ has a history of hyperlipidemia controlled with 
atorvastatin and fenofibrate. Atrovastatin was continued during 
this hospilization and fenofibrate was held. He was also 
continued on daily aspirin.

#) HIV on HAART
Mr. ___ has a history of HIV infection, diagnosed in ___, 
well controlled on highly active antiretroviral therapy. Most 
recent CD4 count in ___ was 653. A viral load was checked 
during hospitalization, which is pending at discharge. During 
this hospitalization he was continued on his usual HAART regimen 
of truvada, norvir and lexiva.
 
#) Diabetes mellites, type II
Mr. ___ has a history of non-insulin dependent type II 
diabetes well controlled on glipizide. During this admission, 
glipizide was held and he was put on an insulin sliding scale. 
Blood sugars were well controlled.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
- The patient will require neuropsychiatry testing at rehab or 
as an outpatient to evaluate for dementia. Geriatrics recommends 
psychiatry follow up as an outpatient.
- No weight bearing in right wrist, ok to bear weight at elbow. 
The patient will follow up with orthopedics as an outpatient.
- Losartan held on admission as patient with orthostatic 
hypotension. Consider restarting as an outpatient if patient 
becomes hypertensive. 
- Patient developed a rash after receiving seroquel. This has 
been listed as an allergy. 
- Viral load pending at discharge. 
- Code status DNR/DNI.
- Health care proxy, ___, ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. As you recall, you were admitted because of 
dizziness and multiple falls. We found that your blood pressure 
dropped when you were standing, which was most likely due to 
being dehydrated. Your blood pressure improved with IV fluids. 
Sometimes falls can be caused by problems with your heart, so we 
also did an ultrasound of your heart and the arteries of your 
neck that did not show anything concerning.

In addition, your kidney function was initially decreased. You 
had a kidney ultrasound that did not show any problems with your 
kidneys and your kidney function improved with IV fluids.

You mentioned difficulties with memory. This can be further 
worked up as an outpatient.

Best Regards,
Your ___ Team
