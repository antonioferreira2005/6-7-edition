History of Present Illness:
A ___ year old male with history of HTN, CAD, ischemic 
cardiomyopathy LVEF 30%, mild AS (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2), renal 
transplant, is admitted with progressive dyspnea. He reports 
that for the past two weeks he has had decreased exercise 
tolerance, previously able to run 30 minutes on tredmill 
starting yesterday he became short of breath with walking 1.5 
blocks. chief complaint of DOE. Has cardiomyopathy ef 30% and 
aortic stenosis. He notes 5lb weight gain over the past week. He

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower 
extremity.
2. Peroneal veins not seen. Moderate edema in the calf.
3. Cystic lesion in the right posterior popliteal fossa, 
presumably ___
cyst.
.
ECHO ___
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior 
septum, inferior and anterior walls and mild dyskinesis of the 
apex. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments with 
the anterior septum and anterolateral walls contracting best 
(LVEF = 25 %). The estimated cardiac index is depressed 
(<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with focal 
hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve 
stenosis (AoVA = 0.8 cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is an 
increased gradient across the mitral valve, but functional 
mitral stenosis is not suggested). Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen (may be underestimated given the increased 
gradient with low cardiac index and lack of mitral stenosis). 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with cavity enlargement and extensive 
regional systolic dysfunction c/w diffuse process (multivessel 
CAD, etc.). Mild mitral regurgitaiton.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the 
severity of aortic valve stenosis has progressed (Doppler 
profile is much cleaner on the current study). The pleural 
effusion has resolved. The transmitral gradient is similar, but 
mitral stenosis is not suggested - suggesting the severity of 
mitral regurgitation may be UNDERestimated.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to estimate 
the severity of mitral regurgitation.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with history of HTN, CAD, ischemic 
cardiomyopathy LVEF 30%, and mild AS admitted with progressive 
dyspnea related to CHF exacerbation.  
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
==============
# Acute on chronic congestive heart failure systolic 
dysfunction: Patient appeared volume overloaded on admission 
related to dietery indescression. LVEF 30% in ___ Repeat Echo 
demonstrated LVEF 25% with extensive systolic dysfunction. He 
was not on furosemide at home because it had made him very 
orthostatic. Here, he was diuresed with IV boluses of lasix 
(___) while holding home antihypertensives. This was 
complicated by mild orthostatic hypotension which has been a 
long standing problem related to diabetic neuropathy. Furosemide 
was not added to his regimen given orthostasis.  He will follow 
up with his PCP ___ ___ and cardiology on ___. Continued ACE.
.
# Aortic Stenosis: Echo in ___ shows mild AS with (valve area 
1.2-1.9cm2). Repeat echo showed worsening AS with valve area of 
0.8 cm2 corresponding to Severe Aortic stenosis. He was 
asymptomatic. Given worsening AS, consideration for AVR was 
recommended which he will discuss with his cardiologist. 
.
# Autonomic neuropathy: Patient is orthostatic at baseline which 
had limited diuretic therapy in the past. Pt continued on home 
midodrine and antihypertensives held during diuresis. 
.
# R>L peripheral edema: Patient reported that uneven swelling 
was new for him but ultrasound was negative for DVT.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES
==============
# CORONARIES: History of moderate 3vd, s/p stents to D1. Pt 
without active chest pain or ischemic changes on EKG; trop 
negative x 1. Continued on ASA 81 mg daily and pravastatin 40 mg 
daily.
.
# S/p Renal transplant: Continued on cyclosporine, home 
Cellcept, prednisone, and Qualaquin prn.  
.
# Diabetes mellitus: Continued on home Lantus 26 qAM with 
Humalog sliding scale.  Also continued on gabapentin for 
peripheral neuropathy.
  .  
# Left facial droop: Patient reports that he has had left facial 
droop since childhood. Denies history of stroke. Cranial nerve 
exam is otherwise unremarkable.  
.  
TRANSITION OF CARE
=================
After discharge:
- Patient will see PCP for volume status, blood pressure check.
- He will need evaluation for aortic valve repair
.
# Code: DNR/DNI.
.
# Emergency contact: ___ ___.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath.  You 
were given medications to remove excess fluid from your heart 
and lungs with improvement of your symptoms.  While you were 
having fluid removed you developed dizziness with standing, 
which you have had multiple times in the past.  However, your 
dizziness had resolved prior to your discharge.  Your oxygen 
levels were within expected normal range on walking and at rest. 
 
.
You underwent a repeat echocardiogram which showed your known 
aortic stenosis is worse.  You will need an outpatient 
evaluation for a possible surgical aortic valve repair.  Please 
follow up with your cardiologist, Dr. ___ this.
.
No changes have been made to your home medications.
