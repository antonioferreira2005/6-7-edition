Approximately 1.5 weeks prior to seeing urgent care, he 
developed ___ L shoulder stabbing/burning pain radiating to his 
neck as well as his left hand. This pain persisted and he saw 
his pcp who recommended taking tramadol. The tramadol (he is

a day, continue with gabapentin for pain control. He was also 
started on valacyclovir 1 g TID for 10 days, as well as 
prednisone 60 mg daily for 4 days.

EKG ___:

___. 
Ventricular ectopy persists without diagnostic interim change. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M PMH significant for non-hodgkin's lymphoma, relapsed 
diffuse large b cell lymphoma s/p 6 cycles of CHOP, no longer on 
protocol for his ___ for peripheral neuropathy who is being 
admitted for neuropathic pain secondary to zoster.

# Post herpetic neuralgia: Patient presented to outpatient 
clinic on ___ with clinical presentation and physical exam that 
was consistent with herpes zoster along left arm. He was treated 
with valacyclovir 1 g TID for 10 days, as well as prednisone 60 
mg daily for 4 days. He was started on Cymbalta and Lyrica. He 
had a cervical epidural block with ropivicaine and steroids with 
anesthesia on ___. His pregabalin was also increased to 150mg 
TID. The intermittent burning/lancenating pain improved 
significantly. He still had significant, ___, dull pain 
throughout the left arm and was also experiencing allodynia. He 
underwent IV lidocaine infusion with 300mg lidocaine over 3 
hours on ___. He had no improvement in his achey left arm pain. 
Oxycodone and tramadol were mostly ineffective; and morphine 
caused significant AMS. He was discharged home on pregabalin 
150mg TID, duloxetine 30mg daily, and valacyclovir 1gm daily. He 
is scheduled to followup in the pain management clinic for 
potential stellate ganglion block as there is suspicion for a 
component of complex regional pain syndrome contributing to the 
patient's post-herpetic left arm pain.

# Peripheral Neuropathy: Improved after discontinuing gabapentin 
and starting duloxetine / pregabalin. Discharged on duloxetine 
30mg daily and pregabalin 150mg TID.

___. Appears euvolemic on exam. Continued losartan, 
carvedilol, and digoxin.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of ___ at ___. 
___ came in for increasing pain in your left shoulder and arm 
which was related to your recent shingles outbreak. We gave ___ 
IV and topical pain medication to help reduce the pain. We 
started 2 new medications, Cymbalta and Lyrica, which have 
helped with the burning sensation. ___ were seen by the pain 
specialists, who performed an epidural injection with 
anesthetics and steroids. They also tried an infusion of IV 
lidocaine. These procedures have yet to significantly reduce the 
achey pain in your left arm. ___ will be discharged with 
followup in the pain management clinic where they will discuss 
the possibility of other procedures to help relieve the pain in 
your arm.

Again, it was a pleasure taking part in your care. We wish ___ a 
speedy recovery and hope to see ___ back out on the golf course 
soon!
