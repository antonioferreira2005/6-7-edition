History of Present Illness:
___ y/o ___ female with pAF (not on AC), ___ with 
daily Lasix use, ___, HTN, HL, OA, spinal stenosis with chronic 
low back pain, uterine cancer (s/p TAH-BSO ___ with lung 
oligometastasis s/p radiation, chronic home O2 2L requirement, 
who presents after a fall with headstrike, now being admitted 
for hypoxia and hypercarbia on VBG.

Today, the patient was getting up to use walker in the bathroom 
and felt as though she was spinning. She has a history of BPPV. 
She fell onto her left side and the back left side of her head 
hit the ground. No LOC. No bleeding or laceration. She takes 
aspirin 81 mg daily but no other blood thinners. Unfortunately 
it is her ___ fall this year. She uses a walker at baseline with 
___ 2x/week. 

- In ED initial VS: 97.6 64 170/78 20 
- Exam: Notable for ~3 cm diameter small circular bruise but no 
skin breakage or bleeding, strength exam generally preserved 
- Labs notable for normal WBC, Plt 118, H/H ___, Na 146, Cr 
1.0, VBG 7.44/70 with bicarb 39, lactate 1.4. 
- She underwent CT head noncon and CT C-spine noncon, which did 
not show acute fracture or intracranial process. She had right 
ankle film, which was concerning for a nondisplaced fx of distal 
fifth metatarsal but subsequent dedicated right foot film was 
negative for acute fracture. 
- Patient was given: PO Acetaminophen 1000 mg, IH Albuterol 
0.083% Neb Soln 1 NEB, IH Ipratropium Bromide Neb 1 NEB, PO/NG 
Diltiazem 120 mg, PO/NG Gabapentin 600 mg 

She was placed in observation for ___ management eval in AM. 
However, at 6 AM patient was noted to be hypoxic to the ___ with 
good pleth on nasal cannula without response at 6 L. She was 
mentating well throughout this time. She was placed on facemask 
with improvement to ___. Given acute change in respiratory 
status, she underwent CTA, which no evidence of PE, but did show 
a masslike consolidation with heterogeneous enhancement 
surrounding fiducial 
marker in the left lower lobe, consistent with known metastatic 
disease. 

Notably, she had a prior hospitalization in ___ where she 
required MICU transfer for hypercarbia and increased somnolence, 
which improved with BiPAP and treatment of PNA. 

On arrival to the MICU, patient was breathing comfortably on 2L 
NC. She denied any pain. Her family was at bedside and felt that 
over the last month, she has been intermittently confused. She 
also had been having some difficulty sleeping and having vivid 
dreams. Sometimes she will be forgetful with events but never 
confused to the point of not recognizing her family members. In 
the ER, she was briefly placed on BiPAP which was removed when 
she came to the MICU.

IMAGING 
=============
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST ___
1. No acute fracture or dislocation.  Mild multilevel 
degenerative changes. 
2. Scattered areas of lucency throughout the bones without 
cortical destruction may relate to osteopenia.  Correlate with 
any history of malignancy. 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___
Suboptimal evaluation of the posterior fossa due to artifact 
from patient motion.  Otherwise, no acute intracranial process 
seen. 
  
Posterior left parietal/temporal subgaleal hematoma without 
underlying acute fracture. 

ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) RIGHT ___
Concern for nondisplaced fracture of the distal fifth 
metatarsal, seen on the lateral view.  Consider dedicated 
imaging of the right foot for further assessment. 
  
No acute fracture or dislocation at the right ankle. 

FOOT AP,LAT & OBL RIGHT ___
No acute fracture or dislocation.  Degenerative changes, most 
severe at the first MTP joint where there is large dorsal 
spurring. 

CXR ___
The lung volumes are markedly low.  Left base opacity is seen 
which could be due worsened chronic atelectasis, however, 
pneumonia, aspiration, underlying pleural effusion or pulmonary 
lesion is not excluded.  Right base atelectasis is stable. The 
cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable. 

CTA CHEST ___
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 
2.  Masslike consolidation with heterogeneous enhancement

There is no evidence of fracture.  The visualized portion of the 
paranasal 
sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  
Patient is

for deep vein thrombosis. 
  
TECHNIQUE:  Grey scale, color, and spectral Doppler evaluation 
was performed on the bilateral lower extremity veins. 
  
COMPARISON:  None. 
  
FINDINGS:

bilateral 
common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins.  The bilateral 
posterior tibial and peroneal calf veins are not well seen. 
  
There is normal respiratory variation in the common femoral 
veins bilaterally. 
  
No evidence of medial popliteal fossa (___) cyst.

daily Lasix use, ___, HTN, HL, OA, spinal stenosis with chronic 
low back pain, uterine cancer with lung oligometastasis s/p 
radiation,  chronic home O2 2L requirement, who presented after 
a fall with headstrike, and was admitted for hypoxia and 
hypercarbia. She initially presented s/p fall. Imaging 
(including head CT, C-spine CT) did not show any significant 
injuries. Initial plan in the ED was for discharge pending ___ 
evaluation, however while in the ED she developed hypoxia 
requiring a facemask. Given the acute change, she underwent CTA 
which did not show evidence of PE. She was admitted to the MICU 
for monitoring. She was initially placed on Bipap in the ER 
which was removed when she came to the MICU. Her hypoxia 
resolved upon admission, and she returned to her baseline 2L o2 
requirement. Her transient hypoxia was attributed to low reserve 
in setting of chronically elevated right hemi-diaphragm and 
prior radiation treatment; imaging did not show an acute 
pulmonary abnormality. Per discussion with her family, given her 
return to baseline, further work-up was not desired. She was 
called out to the floor for further care.
 
While awaiting disposition in the ER she became hypoxemic, 
placed on face mask for O2% in the 60%s. VBG looked stable, with 
chronic compensated hypercarbia and so she was admitted to the 
FICU. These resolved in the ICU without intervention and she has 
been breathing comfortable and stable on her regular home O2 
regimen. 
   
She was transferred from the FICU to the floor. On the floor, 
she became confused and altered which was thought to be related 
to possible hypercarbia related an delirium. She improved during 
the day after her O2 NC was reduced to target O2 sats of 88-92%. 
Pulmonary was consulted during her hospitalization. It was 
discussed that her hypoxemia was likely multifactorial with a 
degree of hypoventilation and shunting through her bibasilar 
consolidations/areas of atelectasis. She also has known HFpEF 
and is predisposed to volume overload. She also has a stable 
moderate pH thus she likely has chronic hypercarbia. It was 
discussed she could consider trial of nocturnal BiPAP providing 
neuromuscular rest during the night and possibly ventilation 
during the day. This will be deferred to the outpatient setting. 
She will need an outpatient sleep study. 
     
# Acute respiratory failure, now resolved
# Chronic respiratory failure related to oligometastases to 
lung,
prior radiation treatment now O2 dependnet.
Acute, transient hypoxemia in the ED with VBG showing 
hypercarbia
with PCO2 of 70 but normal pH. CTA negative for PE and did show
stable mass in LLL from known metastatic disease. No evidence of
acute CHF exacerbation. Low suspicion for PNA. No smoking 
history
and exam not consistent with reactive airways. Potentially acute
aspiration event. Elevated Troponins likely in the setting of
stress related to fall and transient hypoxemia, trending down
without changes in MB or signs or symptoms of NSTEMI.
