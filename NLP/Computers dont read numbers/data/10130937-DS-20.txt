.
Omental cake, biopsy (A) ___: 
Metastatic adenocarcinoma, see note. 
Note:  The tumor is poorly differentiated with signet ring 
morphology. Tumor cells are negative for ER, PR, WT1 (staining 
in stroma and mesothelial cells only) and CDX-2.  Likely primary 
site include gastrointestinal tract or possibly ovary.
.
Gastric body mass, biopsies ___: 
Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells.
.
IMAGING:
.
CT of abd (___):
Large ascites and omental caking/peritoneal implants raise 
concern 
for malignany, possibly due to colonic primary given eccentric 
wall thickening in the transverse colon. The rectum and sigmoid 
colon are normal. The uterus is grossly  normal with numerous 
collaterals and a distended left ovarian vein. There is no 
pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The ovaries appear normal 
with a focal calcification in the right ovary
.
CT Abd/Pelv ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Large volume ascites with omental and peritoneal implants 
compatible with malignancy. 
2. New loculated fluid collection within the right anterior 
abdominal wall with adjacent stranding may relate to recent 
paracentesis and given the adjacent inflammation, superimposed 
infection cannot be excluded. 
3. Focal clot within a left gonadal vein.
. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with PMH of HTN, A-flutter, with recently  
diagnosed malignant ascites with adenocarcinoma cells (of 
unknown primary) with CT demonstrating peritoneal implants and 
transverse colon thickening. Transvaginal ultrasound unable to 
identify ovaries due to excess ascitic fluid. She now presents 
with a sudden onset of right sided abdominal 
pain/constipation/obstipation, and dx paracentesis suggestive of 
SBP.  
.
Active Diagnoses:
.
#Stage IV Poorly Differentiated Gastric Adenocarcinoma with 
signet ring features: Ms. ___ was admitted with abdominal 
pain and constipation and found to have evidence of widely 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary throughout her 
peritoneum. Differential diagnosis included colonic despite 
negative colonoscopy, ovarian (given poor visualization by 
vaginal ultrasound), primary peritoneal, or upper GI source. An 
___ biopsy taken from omental caking was positive for 
adenocarcinoma (confirming ascitic fluid cytology results). 
Given the patient's significant history of gastritis, EGD was 
performed which showed larged gastric tumor which was biopsied 
with pathology significant for poorly differentiated gastric 
adenocarcinoma with signet ring features. She was discharged 
with outpatient follow-up with Dr. ___ futher management 
of her malignancy.
.
#Malignant Ascites/Abdominal Pain/Obstipation: On admission Ms. 
___ complained of abdominal pain and lack of BM's or flatus 
for several days which raised concern for SBO despite lack of 
SBO on CT abdomen performed in ED. She was also found to have 
tense ascites and underwent diagnostic paracentesis in the ED 
which showed ascitic fluid which a high white count and >250 
poly's despite being lymphocyte predominant which raised concern 
for bacterial peritonitis from paracentesis performed during 
prior admission. She was also found to have a loculated 
abdominal wall mass at the site of her prior paracentesis. She 
was afebrile, alert and oriented, and did not have diffuse 
abdominal tenderness on exam. Additionally, the site of her 
loculated fluid collection was not particularly warm, 
erythematous, tender, or fluctuant. She was started on IV 
ceftriaxone emprirically pending culture results of her dx para 
fluid and ceftriaxone was d/c'd when her cultures came back 
negative. She underwent therapeutic paracentesis which removed 
~1.5L of fluid and greatly improved her abdominal discomfort and 
constipation. She was also given an aggressive bowel regimen and 
was able to pass BM's and flatus frequently.  
.  
# Hx of Aflutter: Per Dr. ___ had one known episode of 
aflutter while previously hospitalized and is not currently in 
aflutter and probably hasn't been since. As a result, it was 
determined that she did not require anticoagulation as her risk 
for bleeding was thought to outweigh her risk for cardioembolic 
event. Her home warfarin was d/c'd and she was given instruction 
to follow-up with her outpatient providers for further 
discussion of this issue.  
.  
#Hyponatremia/Hypokalemia: This was a new finding for this 
patient with a Na of 129. It remained stable after placing her 
on a 1.2L fluid restriction.  
.
Chronic Diagnoses: 
.
# Heartburn: Stable, likely related to or contributing to 
formation of her gastric cancer. She was treated symptomatically 
with pantoprazole, maalox, and tums  
.
Transitional Issues: Ms. ___ was discharged with close 
follow-up with Dr. ___ continued outpatient management 
of her newly diagnosed gastric cancer. She was also advised to 
discuss the discontinuation of her warfarin with her PCP.
