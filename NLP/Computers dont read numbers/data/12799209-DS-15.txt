Chief Complaint:
Exercise Intolerance in Lower Extremity now progressed to Upper 
Extremities
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
___ yo. w/PMH of LBP d/t DDD s/p L5-S1 laminectomy in ___ and 
morbid obesity, now complaining of progressive proximal 
weakness. Pt noticed weakness in her legs, and a sore & achy 
feeling in her legs about 1 month ago. She initially attributed 
this to straining her back after lifting a mattress. This she 
initially iced, and it gradually resolved, especially since 
recent prescription of tizanidine, although pt also had one 
recent ED visit for sciatica, which now has almost stopped 
bothering her. However, pt's weakness-related symptoms have 
progressed, especially over the last few days to the point where 
she feels she has to stop walking after ___ minutes because her 
leg muscles get progressively weaker and sorer if she goes on, 
she feels like she is working out hard, and she feels like her 
legs might give out on her (though she has not fallen). She has 
not had cramps. Walking up stairs also is difficult, and she has 
to stop every few steps on the way up to her ___ 
apartment. Over the last ___ days, pt has also noticed weakness 
and soreness
in her arms, e.g., has to switch hands every couple of minutes 
when holding the phone up during a phone conversation. By 
history, all her weakness is proximal, there is no distal 
weakness and she has not been dropping things. There are also no 
sensory symptoms, and no impairment of bowel or bladder 
function. Pt is very worried about the progression of her 
symptoms, and is
concerned about "ending up in a wheelchair", or "waking up being 
unable to move".

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo. w/PMH of LBP d/t DDD s/p L5-S1 laminectomy in ___, now 
complaining of progressive proximal weakness. Pt noticed 
weakness in her legs, and a sore & achy feeling in her legs 
about 1 month ago. She initially attributed this to straining 
her back after lifting a mattress. These symptoms have 
progressed over the last few days to the point where she feels 
she has to stop walking after ___ minutes because her leg 
muscles get progressively weaker and sorer if she goes on, she 
feels like she is working out hard, and she feels like her legs 
might give out on her (though she has not fallen). Walking up 
stairs also is difficult, and she has to stop every few steps on 
the way up to her ___ appartment. Over the last ___ days, 
pt has also noticed weakness and soreness in her arms, e.g., has 
to switch hands every couple of minutes when holding the phone 
up during a phone conversation. 

# Weakness / Exercise Intolerance:
We performed an EMG study including single fiber for 
myopathy/myasthenia which were strongly suggestive of Myasthenia 
___. ESR, C3/C4 were WNL, CRP was elevated to 6.  TSH was 
slightly elevated, T4,T3 were WNL. ___, Anti-dsDNA 
were sent and pending.  

CT scan of the Chest revealed mass concerning for Thymoma for 
which thoracic surgery was consulted.  MRI performed for better 
visualization to aid in possible resection.  Neuromuscular 
formal consult for pre-operative management recommended starting 
Mestinon, CellCept and Bactrim PPx.

# Lower Back Pain:
Tizanidine, Gabapentin, Ibuprofen were all continued.

# Hypertension:
Home Toprol XL was continued and ECG showed NSR.

# Depression:
Duloxetine was continued as well as Benztropine for any 
hyperhidrosis with good effect.  

# Migraine:
Also Prochlorperazine was continued for any Migrainous pain.

Discharge Instructions:
You were evaluated at ___ for 
your chief complaint of difficulty walking for more than a few 
minutes without progressive pain in the lower extremities, which 
has progressed to your arms over the past few days.  

We performed an EMG study to further evaluate your muscle 
weakness, as on examination we noted a fatiguable quality.  The 
set of tests which were performed were strongly suggestive of 
Myasthenia ___ for which we sent a series of blood tests.  We 
also performed a CT scan of the chest as a tumor known as a 
Thymoma can be associated with the symptoms that you describe.  
We identified a mass concerning for this type of tumor in your 
chest, for which we consulted our thoracic surgery team to 
perform an evaluation of you as a surgical candidate to remove 
the Thymoma.

We also consulted our Neuromuscular diseases team to assess you 
for any preliminary tests or steps that were necessary to 
perform prior to clearance for your surgical procedure.
WE started you on Mestinon and Cellcept for diagnosis of 
Myesthenia ___. You should take these medications as 
directed. You have to make an appointment in 4 weeks with 
neuromuscular. 
You also need weekly blood draws: This can start on ___ this 
will check your CBC while you are on the cellcept. The results 
can faxed to Dr ___.
