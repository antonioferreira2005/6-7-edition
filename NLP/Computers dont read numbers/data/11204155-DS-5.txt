Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ male who presented to ___ with 
complaint of nausea/emesis and outpatient MRCP findings of 
choledocholithiasis and gallbladder adenomyomatosis. His labwork 
was unremarkable. Given his symptoms and the MRCP findings, 
however, he went with the GI team for ERCP with sphincterotomy 
and sludge extraction. General surgery was subsequently 
consulted for surgical management. The following day, he 
underwent cholecystectomy and was transferred to the surgical 
service. The procedure was complicated by bowel noted to be 
adherent to the gallbladder requiring an extension of the 
surgical incision as well as running the bowel without any bowel 
injury noted. Also, due to the high degree of inflammation, a 
partial laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed with a small 
segment of infundibulum remaining. Given EBL of 200cc, a JP 
drain was left in place in the RUQ that produced serosanguinous, 
non-bilious output during his post-operative course. 
Intraoperatively, the patient intermittently required 
phenylephrine but was hemodynamically stable post-operatively 
and did not require additional pressors or fluid rescusitation. 
He remained afebrile. 
His diet was advanced to fulls on the evening of POD0 and then 
regular diet on POD1, which he tolerated well. His pain regimen 
was switched from IV to oral once he tolerated a diet with good 
relief. Post-operatively, flagyl was added to the ciprofloxacin. 
He will continue on ciprofloxacin/flagyl at home after discharge 
for a total 5-day course. He ambulated and self-catheterized per 
his usual routine without difficulty during his stay. He will be 
discharged home on POD2 with the JP drain in place with ___ 
care. He will be seen in clinic for follow up in one week for 
drain removal.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the general surgery service after having 
gallstones and sludge removed from your bile duct by the GI 
doctors during ___. You received IV antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) 
and underwent removal of your gallbladder by the surgery 
service. The incision had to be extended because your 
gallbladder was very inflamed. A very small portion of the 
gallbladder was left because it was unsafe to remove it but the 
procedure otherwise went well.  You are now taking a regular 
diet. You will be discharged home to complete a 4-day course of 
oral ciprofloxacin and flagyl. You should follow up in general 
surgery clinic in two weeks. 

Please follow the discharge instructions below:

ACTIVITY:
- Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
- You may climb stairs. You should continue to walk several 
times a day. 
- You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit. 
- You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as 
tolerated.
- Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first. 
- No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your 
surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. 

HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
- You may feel weak or "washed out" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
- You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the surgery.

YOUR BOWELS:
- Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine 
such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk 
of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
- If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.
- After removal of your gallbladder, diarrhea can occur. If you 
get diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty 
of fluids and it will likely resolve on its own. If it does not 
go away, or is severe and you feel ill, please call your 
surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
- You are being discharged with a prescription for oxycodone for 
pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to exceed 
3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after surgery 
but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses if you 
are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may take 
the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled by the 
Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics to 
help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly wean 
off these medications as tolerated. 
- Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.

MEDICATIONS:
- Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just 
as you did before, unless you have been told differently.
- If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not 
to take, please call your surgeon. 

WOUND CARE: 
- dressing removal: Your outer gauze dressings were removed 
prior to discharge home. 
-Starting today, you may shower with any bandage strips that may 
be covering your wound. Do not scrub and do not soak or swim, 
and pat the incision dry. Steri strips, will fall off by 
themselves in ___ weeks. If any are still on in two weeks and 
the edges are curling up, you may carefully peel them off. Do 
not take baths, soak, or swim for 6 weeks after surgery unless 
told otherwise by your surgical team. 
-Notify your surgeon is you notice abnormal (foul smelling, 
bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site, 
opening of your incision, or increased pain or bruising. Watch 
for signs of infection such as redness, streaking of your skin, 
swelling, increased pain, or increased drainage. 

DRAIN CARE:
 
You are being discharged with drains in place. Drain care is a 
clean procedure. Wash your hands with soap and warm water before 
performing your drain care, which you should do ___ times a day. 
Try to empty the drain at the same time each day. Pull the 
stopper out of the bottle and empty the drainage fluid into the 
measuring cup. Record the amount of fluid on the record sheet, 
and reestablish drain suction. **--A visiting nurse ___ help 
you with your drain care.--**
- Clean around the drain site(s) where the tubing exits the skin 
with soap and water. Be sure to secure your drains so they don't 
hang down loosely and pull out. 
-Strip the drain tubing, empty the bulb(s), and record the 
output ___ times a day as described above. 
-Keep a written record of the daily amount from each drain and 
bring this to every follow up appointment. Your drains will be 
removed once the output tapers off to an acceptable amount. 

If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon: 
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness
- cough, shortness of breath, wheezing
- pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever
- shaking chills, fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
- nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or 
your medications
- if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, 
feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing)

allowing us to participate in your care. We hope you have a 
quick return to your usual life and activities.
