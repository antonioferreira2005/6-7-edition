History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: ___ male w/ h/o IVDU and 
HCV who initially presented to OSH ___ w/ altered mental status. 
He was accompanied by his brother who reported 4-day history of 
shoulder pain and unspecified rash. Patient was febrile to 
101.8, tachycardic to 120s, otherwise hemodynamically stable. 
Labs were notable for WBC 19, lactate 2.1, Cr 1.5 (baseline 
1.0), troponin 0.61, NTproBNP of 6600, and transaminitis (AST 
155, ALT 123, Tbili 1.1, alk phos 107). Utox positive for 
opioids. EKG with sinus tachycardia; no heart block or ischemic 
changes. CXR remarkable for bilateral lower lobe infiltration 
and increased pulmonary vascular markings. CT abdomen with 
splenomegaly and 2.3 x 1.4 x 1.4 hypoattenuated subcapsular 
lesion concerning for septic embolus. BCx ___ positive 
for GNR later speciated as S. marcescens. UCx likewise positive 
for S. marcescens. TTE initially unremarkable for endocarditis, 
albeit poorly visualized aortic valve. TEE was therefore 
pursued, which demonstrated a large, predominant RCC aortic 
valve vegetation with associated abscess cavity freely 
communicating with the LVOT and 4+ AR. CTA head without evidence 
of septic emboli.  

 

Empiric vancomycin/imipenem initiated for endocarditis. Empiric 
acyclovir and corticosteroids added for concern for meningitis. 
HCP deferred LP. Prior to transfer, patient complained of chest 
pain. Became tachycardic to 140s; pressures dropped to ___. 
Repeat EKG showed isolated 1mm ST depressions in V4, unchanged 
from prior study. CTA chest without pulmonary artery filling 
defect. Required intermittent Haldol for delirium. He was 
transferred to ___ CCU in anticipation of surgical management.

 

On arrival to the CCU, patient was unable to participate in 
interview on account of altered mental status.

Imaging:
ECHO ___
Prebypass
 No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left 
atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen 
by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more 
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. An aortic 
annular abscess is seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. 
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on 
the mitral valve. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due 
to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may 
be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no 
pericardial effusion. Dr. ___ was notified in person 
of the results on ___ at 1015 am. A left pleural effusion 
is present. Post bypass
Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of Epinephrine, 
Vasopressin and Norepinephrine. Biventricular systolic function 
is mildly depressed. LVEF= 45% . Annuloplasty ring seen in the 
mitral position. It appears well seated. Moderate mitral 
regurgitation seen. Mean gradient across the mitral valve is 6 
mm Hg. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. It 
appears well seated. Trivial central aortic insufficiency seen. 
Mean gradient across the aortic valve is 22 mm Hg. Aorta intact 
post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Medical Service work-up:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: ___ male w/ h/o IVDU and HCV 
admitted to OSH with sepsis found to have aortic valve infective 
endocarditis c/b 4+ AR and S. marcescens bacteremia; transferred 
in anticipation of surgical intervention. 
#) PUMP: aortic valve endocarditis/abscess with 4+ AR, as above  
 
#) RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia 
#) Sepsis
#) S. marcecens bacteremia
#) AV infective endocarditis c/b perivalvular abscess and severe 
AR: transient hypotension per OSH report, but otherwise 
hemodynamically stable at present without shock. MAPs acceptable 
in the absence of diuresis or afterload reduction. Serial BCx 
speciated as S. marcecens, susceptible to carbapenem. 
Hematogenous spread via urinary source (i.e., UCx similarly with 
Serratia and CT abdomen with perinephric stranding) versus 
needle contamination. Could de-escalate, given susceptibility 
profile, with mindfulness of listed PCN/cephalosporin allergies. 
MRSA screen negative. Tentatively planned for Bentall ___. CTA 
head at OSH without evidence of intracranial septic emboli. We 
consulted Cardiac Surgery, and Infectious disease. We also 
treated with meropenam 500mg and per ID we d/c's his vancomycin. 
We also got fungal blood cultures. The patient was s/p 
imipenem/cilastatin (___).
#) Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: hyperactive delirium, 
requiring pharmacologic restraint. Presume related to 
bacteremia, as above. No evidence of septic emboli on CTA head. 
Initially received empiric coverage for meningitis at OSH; LP 
deferred. UDS positive for opioids, but otherwise negative. 
Other drug effect or withdrawal conceivable; received trivial 
amount of BZ at OSH.  We treated with antibiotics as listed 
above. 
#) Troponiemia: 0.87 -> 0.84 (___) at OSH. SS chest pain prior 
to transfer. ___epression in V4 unchanged from prior. 
NTproBNP 6000; suspect AR-related strain in that regard. We got 
repeat EKGs and repeated his troponins
#) ___, non-oliguric: Cr 1.5 (baseline 1.0) -> 1.1 on arrival. 
Probable transient hypotension/sepsis. Septic emboli and/or 
immunologic phenomenon in the context of IE conceivable, though 
no dysmorphic RBCs/casts on UA.  
#) Coagulopathy: isolated minor ___ prolongation. Probable 
diminished synthetic function in the context of hypoalbuminemia 
and seemingly cirrhotic liver. We trended his coagulation 
factors. 
#) HCV
#) Transaminitis: suspect untreated HCV, given nodular hepatic 
surface and splenomegaly on CT abdomen, suggesting cirrhotic 
change. 
#) Opioid use disorder: active IVDU; details uncertain. Will 
obtain collateral. We consulted ___ for opioid addiction consult.
Cardiac Surgery Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent root enlargement with root patch/AVR 
#23CE/MVr #28mm ring.  Overall the patient tolerated the 
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU 
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  He 
arrived out on Levo/vaso/Epi gtt. He was weaned off all gtts 
within ___. Remained intubated for few days due to mental 
status, confusion agitation. Patient was confused pre-op with 
concern for septic emboli pre-op. He was seen by the neurology 
service and underwent imaging MRI showed multiple lesions 
consistent with septic emboli.Continuous EEG has revealed no 
seizures.
 He was extubated on POD2, remained very tachypneic with 
significant resp alkalosis. This was associated with 
hypertension and tachycardia. In light of drug history 
withdrawal syndrome was a concern and his narcotics were 
adjusted to meet his pain needs. Lopressor and Lasix started. 
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery 
protocol without difficulty or complications. His menatal status 
was slow to improve, he was seen by neurology and addiction 
services. He had a negative head CT. 
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery.  The patient worked with nursing and was evaluated by 
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and 
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 13 the patient was 
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled 
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to the 
___ in good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions. He will need to complete a six week course of 
antibiotics prior to discharge. He may benefit from continued 
addiction counseling +/- suboxone therapy
