septic joint requiring bedside and OR drainages

# R thumb Septic joint 
# R thumb abscess
# R hand soft tissue infection 
Patient presented with worsening R hand pain and swelling in 
setting of recent trauma (reported shutting finger in car door). 
 Reported intranasal cocaine use, but denied recent injection 
drug use.  Initially underwent bedside drainage prior to 
admission to medicine.  Patient started on vancomycin + 
cefepime.  Hospital course complicated by worsening pain and 
swelling, prompting OR drainage and washout that showed 
persistent purulence and communication of infection to joint 
space.  Wound cultures subsequently grew Strep Group C and MRSA. 
 Patient seen by ID and therapy was narrowed to vancomycin.   
Pain initially controlled with oxycodone, which was weaned and 
discontinued prior to discharge--discharged with prescriptions 
for NSAID and Tylenol.  Discharged with instructions for TID 
soaks with hibiclens, dressing with adaptic and gauze.  Has 
follow-up scheduled with Dr. ___ hand surgery in ___ weeks.  
On day of discharge, her vanco trough was 12.1--per discussion 
with ID, she was recommended for repeat trough on ___, to be 
faxed to OPAT, with plan for subsequent decision re: dose 
adjustment at that time. Plan for antibiotics to continue until

of transition to oral agent to complete remainder of extended 
course for septic joint.

ambulated without issue during remainder of hospital stay.

during this admission.  Received IV thiamine on admission.  Was 
monitored on CIWA without signs of withdrawal.  Continued on 
thiamine + folate at discharge 

# Cocaine abuse

opiates---for the latter she had already received IV opiate pain

admitted to  intranasal cocaine use, but declined counseling.
