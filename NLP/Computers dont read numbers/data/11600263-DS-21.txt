RELEVANT STUDIES:

- MRI SPINE C/T/L W/O CONTRAST (___):
1. There are T1 and T2 hypointense sclerotic osseous lesions 
throughout the entire cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. In 
the thoracic spine, at T3 and T12, there are T2 hyperintense 
enhancing lesions.  Clinical correlation with bone scan or PET 
scan may yield additional information if clinically indicated. 
2. Multilevel degenerative changes as described above without 
evidence of 
acute compression of the cord or cauda equina. 
3. L2-3 level, there is a right paracentral disc protrusion, 
with associated high signal of the disc and marrow edema pattern 
of the L2 vertebra which may represent traumatic herniation and 
fracture of the vertebra, although this is difficult to 
ascertain as there is no loss of vertebral body height where 
clear fracture line/defect.  Clinical correlation is 
recommended. CT of the lumbar spine may yield additional 
information if clinically indicated. 

- BRONCHIAL TISSUE BIOPSY (___): 
1. PATHOLOGY: Adenocarcinoma, morphologically similar to that 
seen in the prior pleural biopsy (___), see note.
2. CYTOLOGY: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Consistent with 
metastatic adenocarcinoma. Polymorphous lymphocytes present 
consistent with lymph node sampling.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with stage 4 NSCLC with extensive bone mets, 
and history of pulmonary emboli on Lovenox, who presents with 
with worsening right hip pain. Most likely secondary to 
increased diffuse tumor burden. Has had radiation in the past, 
which gave her ___ months of relief. During this 
hospitalization, pain medication regimen was markedly uptitrated 
(see below), and pt underwent a second round of palliative 
radiation to the affected area, with great relief. Was 
discharged home in stable condition on new regimen with pt 
planning to provide for her own home ___.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Pain was eventually controlled on a dose of oxycontin at 320mg 
q8h, plus PO dilaudid ___ q3h prn for breakthrough pain, and 
gabapentin 300mg q8h. 
- Pt was seen by rad/onc, who did a PET for mapping and then 
began pt on a course of palliative radiation to R sacrum/ileum 
for her R hip pain
- Pt's insurance required prior authorization for her oxycontin 
dose, and we had difficulty finding a pharmacy that could fill 
this prescription. ___ can deliver 1 week's worth 
before discharge, and pt can return next week for the remainder 
of this month's supply. After this she can go to the ___ 
___ for refills.
- Pt also got an endobronchial biopsy the day before discharge, 
by Interventional Pulmonology while admitted, in order to be 
enrolled in a clinical trial. 
- Has f/u appts w/ outpatient oncologist and w/ the IP team
- Pt was seen regularly by ___ and is now able to ambulate 
independently with a walker, including transitions and 
self-care.
- Pt has in-home nursing care already due to her partner's 
healthcare needs
- Pt has a prescription for a bedside commode as it is difficult 
for her to make transfers with a lower toilet.
