History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old male with MM s/p allogeneic stem 
cell transplant from unrelated donor in ___ last seen

negative SPEP/UPEP. He presents from ___ where he was admitted 
with fevers, nausea, vomiting and inability to tolerate 4 days 
prior to presentation. At his evaluation on ___, his ppx 
acyclovir and bactrim were d/c'ed. 4 days PTP he reports being

erosion to definitively suggest infection. Please correlate 
clinically. 

Renal USS ___ No evidence of hydronephrosis, renal calculi,

reflect patient body habitus.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with MM s/p allogenic stem cell transplant in 
___ with recent evaluation which was negative for any 
evidence of recurrence who presents with fevers at an OSH and 
has now developed a cough along with a crusted lesion in the 
___ his forehead and two new papulous lesions.  He has 
stopped taking prophylactic acyclovir and bactrim on ___.  
He was transferred from an OSH for further evaluation.
.
Disseminated Herpes Zoster: Patient presented with vesicular 
rash in left V1 distribution, fevers, two new umbilicated 
lesions inside left arm.  Overnight, he also developed 
erythematous, raised lesions inside his thighs, as well as pain 
in a dermatomal distribution across his right flank.  ID and 
dermatology were consulted.  He was initialyl started on 
antibiotics and high dose acyclovir.  DFA was positive was VZV. 
Chest X-ray showed evidence of left lung base consolidation.  
Patient was treated with high dose acyclovir and levofloxacin.  
His fevers and rash improved, and pain resolved.  He completed a 
course of levofloxacin in hospital.  Once all lesions had 
crusted over, he was transitioned to PO valacyclovir.  
Amitryptiline was started as prophylaxis for post-herpetic 
neuralgia.  The patient will continue taking valacyclovir for a 
further 9 days and then transition to prophylactic acyclovir.
.
Right flank pain: Patient reported right flank pain in a 
dermatomal distribution, worsening over the firs two nights of 
admission.  Pain appeared superficial, could be elicited by 
light touch.  U/A, renal ultrasound were negative for any 
evidence of renal pathology.  He was started on gabapentin and 
amitryptiline for neuropathic pain, as well as dilaudid, and the 
pain improved significantly.  At the time of discharge, the 
patient had no flank pain.
.
Eye erythema: Left eye was erythematous on presentation.  
Eyeleid swollen adn erythematous.  Ophthalmology was consulted, 
but did not feel that the eye was directly involved by zoster 
ophthalmicus or other infection.  Erythema more likely related 
to eyelid inflammation.  As the facial rash improved, the red 
eye too resolved.
.
Acute kidney injury: Creatinine was 1.6 on admission, likely due 
to vancomycin toxity due to supratherapeutic dosing at OSH.  ___ 
also exacerbated by volume depletion (FeNA 0.48).  Patient was 
hydrated at 125 ml/hr, and vancomycin was discontinued.  
Creatinine was trending down and had improved to 1.4 on the day 
of discharge.
.
Hypertension:
continued nifedipine 60 mg qd; continued metoprolol.
.
Depression: Continued home dose duloxetine.
