Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ 
___ female with history of DLBCL with known CNS 
involvement s/p 6 cycles R-mini-CHOP 8 cycles of HD-MTX and now
C2 of Temodar.

ACUTE ISSUES:
#DLBCL with CNS Involvement: She completed 6 cycles R-mini-CHOP
and 8 cycles of HD-MTX. She is in systemic remission, however,
she still has evidence of disease in her brain and progression
based on symptoms above and in most recent CSF. She was started
on IV Dexamethasone 4mg BID on ___ for symptom control. Her
dose was tapered down to 2mg daily outpatient and this was
continued on admission. We attempted to wean steroids, but
headache worsened, so now back on 2 mg daily of dex. Now
s/p C2 Temodar.
-Temozolamide 200mg IV daily (___), patient written 
for
prescription outpatient, however with evolving mucositis plan 
for
IV administration in-house. will look into suspension options 
for
future cycles to take at home as does not tolerate pills well 
regardless of mucositis sx.
-remain on 2mg dex daily
-Restart PJP ppx for now (Bactrim)
-neupogen began ___ for neutropenia (likely chemo related) off 
as of ___ with count recovery
-Follow up appointment to be arranged with Dr. ___, 
___ or sooner if issues arise

# Myalgias, concern for ILI: 
- respiratory precautions
- influenza negative
- respiratory viral panel with insufficient sample, repeat PCR
___ PND will f/u

# dyspnea on exertion: states worsened over last few days,
EKG/CXR WNL. ambulatory sat WNL. likely due to deconditioning
although can not exclude PE in setting of oncologic risk and
decrease motility
-CTA to r/o PE--neg
-monitor sx/sx
-consider echo and/or stress testing outpatient for further w/u 
if worsening sx Per daughter, her baseline dyspnea on exertion 
has been the same to her

#mucositis: stable. supportive care/pain
meds prn. if unable to take pills will change to IV's as able.
on IV temodar inhouse ___.

#Dysphagia/Voice Hoarseness: Significantly improved since last
discharge, now able to tolerate regular diet. Low threshold for
ENT/SLP consultations if worsening sx.

#Neurological Symptoms [Headache, Tinnitus > L, Blurred Vision]:
Ongoing symptoms, have not worsened since discharge on ___,
attributed to CNS involvement of her lymphoma. She received
HD MTX followed by 5 days of Temozolomide as above. 

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================
#Bilateral Hip/Leg pain: currently resolved. Started on ___
She has had no recent trauma or injury that preceded the event.
No exacerbating factors. Took Tylenol at home with good effect.
Her gait is stable and she can weight bear. She has no fevers,
back pain, numbness, tingling, new rashes or changes in bowel
habits so less likely occult hip fracture/lumbar radiculopathy.
Her steroid use increases the risk for osteonecrosis so will
obtain a plain x-ray first for evaluation. X-ray showed minimal
asymmetric right greater than left hip osteoarthritis. There was
no evidence of fracture or dislocation 
-Continue supportive pain management with Oxycodone/Tylenol PRN
-If worsens, consider further imaging with MRI

#GERD: Continue famotidine resumed omeprazole since MTX 
clearance.

#Constipation: Stooling daily, continue Colace and Senna PRN
