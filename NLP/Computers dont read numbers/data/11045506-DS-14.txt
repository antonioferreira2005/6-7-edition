Final Report
FINDINGS:  Again seen is diffuse interstitial abnormality with 
predominance in
the upper lobes consistent with patient's known history of 
sarcoidosis.  The
previously seen opacity at the left base is no longer present 
and was likely
due to artifact.  There is no definite focal consolidation, 
pleural effusion
or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  
Bony structures
are intact.
 
IMPRESSION:  Diffuse interstitial lung disease with an upper 
lobe predominance
consistent with patient's known history of sarcoidosis without 
definite
worsening.  No focal opacity.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old woman with a history of  interstitial lung 
disease thought ___ sarcoidosis, COPD/asthma, active smoker ___ 
cigarettes/day) presenting with shortness of breath most likely 
due to her uncontrolled asthma.

#asthma/COPD exacerbation- She initially presented with 
shortness of breath and a non-productive cough. Initially her O2 
sats were 89% on 3L NC. A CXR showed diffuse interstitial lung 
disease without evidence of worsening from prior imaging. She 
was found to have relative eosinophilia but no leukocytosis. She 
was treated with albuterol and ipratropium nebs, oral 
prednisone, and PO azithromycin for 5 days over the course of 
the hospitalization her O2 sats improved to 97-99% on RA and 
90-94% while ambulating. She was discharged on a prednisone 
taper and the last 2 days of her azithromycin course. She did 
not require oxygen on discharge, but was encouraged to use her 
home oxygen as needed. 

During the hospitalization, she was seen by the pulmonology team 
during who recommended DLCO evaluation as an outpatient, but who 
believed that her current symptoms were likely due to her poorly 
controlled asthma. Key triggers include continued smoking, 
environmental allergens, and 50 lb weight gain over the past few 
years. The patient is scheduled to follow up with an allergist. 
The patient is also scheduled to follow up with her 
pulmonologist Dr. ___. 

#GERD- The pulmonology team recommended treatment with 
omeprazole 20 mg QD to treat a possible GERD etiology for her 
cough.

#smoking- Encouraged smoking sensation and offered nicotine 
patches during hospitalization.
