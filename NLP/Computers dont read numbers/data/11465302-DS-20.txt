Service: MEDICINE
 
Allergies: 
glimepiride
 
Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
fever,shortness of breath
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated ___  
Extubated ___
 
History of Present Illness:
___ y. M with history of CLL (not on treatment), HTN, CKD
(baseline Cr of 1.5) who presented on ___ night with fevers 
to
103. Initial workup was unremarkable. CXR negative. UA negative.
He was started on vancomycin/cefepime empirically awaiting
additional cultures. He has subsequently decompensated and was
transferred to the ___ for hypoxic respiratory failure.  On
___, he was on room air. Since that time, he has had rapidly
progressing hypoxia, requiring titration of NC. Overnight, he
became more short of breath. Repeat CXR shows new effusion and
RLL infiltrate. He then became increasingly tachypneic. and was
placed on 6L NC with nasal CPAP. An ABG on those settings, which
was definitely arterial, which showed ___. For this, he
was put on a nonrebreather.  CXR significant for RML infiltrate
consistent with pneumonia, found to have legionella pneumonia. 
He
was intubated on ___, initially requiring paralysis. He 
was
treated broadly with vancomycin, cefepime, levaquin. Initially,
he had high ventilator settings, with high PEEP and FiO2. Given
his refractory hypoxemia there was a concern for possible shunt
physiology. . TTE this admission did not demonstrate PFO/ASD, 
but
prior TTE demonstrated possible PFO. With the addition of
Veletri, his oxygenation improved significantly and his
ventilatory support was weaned. He underwent bronchoscopy on 
___
which returned negative for other infectious etiologies. In
conjunction with infectious disease, he was subsequently 
narrowed
to levofloxacin alone with a planned three week course for
treatment. Given his concurrent acute renal failure, he was
initiated on CRRT for volume removal. He improved and was
extubated on ___. He was weaned off levophed on ___. 
Paralytics
were d/c'ed on ___. 
He developed acute anuric renal failure thought to be secondary
to ATN. Renal ultrasound without abnormalities. He was initiated
on CRRT on ___ via a right temporary dialysis line. Due to
concerns that volume overload may be contributing to his
respiratory failure, volume was removed via CRRT. He had some
mild hypotension in the setting of fluid removal, for which he
required intermittent levophed. CRRT ended on ___. At the
time of his transfer from the ICU to the floor, he was beginning
to make urine, with a plan for intermittent HD as necessary 
until
his kidney function recovered.
His urine output was as follows:
___ 400
___ 150
___ 200
___ 100
___ 200
___ 200
___ 325
His creatinine rose from 1.5 to peak at 4.3.
In terms of his CLL he had some mild elevations in uric acid
which was concerning for possible tumor lysis syndrome, although
his LDH was stable and other electrolytes WNL. He was initiated
on allopurinol which was later discontinued given his
deterioration in renal function. He was also given a dose of
rasbicurase. In conjunction with his outpatient oncologist,
treatment of his CLL is being considered, but should be deferred
until the resolution of the acute infection. At the
recommendation of his oncologist, he should receive IVIG if IgG 
<
500, although IgG> 500 as measured this hospitalization.
He also developed acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy. ___ and
___, patient had significant anxiety and delirium,
which was managed with Seroquel (not a home medication).
Upon call out to the floor he developed a brief episode of
vertigo when he was placed in ___ to be repositioned
which resolved upon upright posture. He denied further vertigo 
at
the time of examination. He denies chest pain, shortness of
breath. He is concerned about nausea but denies nausea 
currently.
He has a flexiseal in place for loose stool but his cdiff was
negative. He did not report diarrhea to me. He tells me that his
breathing is much better. Per RN he ate soup and crackers and 
has
a good intake of po fluids. His weight has decreased from 116 kg
to 105.8. His LOS fluid balance is -5855. He was continued on
glargine ___s SSI.  Overnight he is maintained on 
CPAP
on room air with 12cm H2O pressure. His CPAP machine was
interrogated by respiratory and he has used it for 8 hours since
___. 
.
A ten point review of systems is otherwise negative except as
above. 
.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year old male with PMHx CLL, admission for 
influenza in ___ who was admitted with fevers and 
tachycardia then developed hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS 
found to have Legionella PNA, course further complicated by 
anuric ___ (now improved).

# HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE ___
# Legionella PNA
Patient initially required intubation for hypoxic respiratory 
failure.  Patient found to have RLL infiltrate on chest imaging 
for which he was initially treated with vanc/cefepime.  However, 
he was found to have a positive Legionella urine antigen and was 
subsequently transitioned to levofloxacin.  Per ID consult team, 
plan is for a total 3 week course of levofloxacin (last day on 
___.  Patient also developed concurrent acute anuric renal 
failure, requiring CRRT in the medical ICU and required a single 
HD session on ___ hypoxia may have also been related to a 
component of volume overload in the setting of his renal 
failure.  He has been weaned to RA currently.  

# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
The patient developed anuric ___.  ___ felt to be related to 
septic ATN.  He had no evidence of AIN based on his urine 
sediment.  Patient required CRRT in the FICU
for voume overload and rising potassium and last underwent a 
single session of HD on ___.  Since ___, he began to 
experience UOP and his renal function has stabilized with clear 
signs of recovery.  He has been having stable UOP (~1.5L) daily 
and with stable electrolytes.  Per Renal, he has no further need 
for HD and will continue outpatient management.  Of note, his 
PPD is negative.  Will need to be maintained on a low K/Phos 
renal diet pending further improvement of his renal function; no 
need for a fluid restriction at time of discharge.  BUN/Cr on 
day of discharge 64/3.7 (improved from BUN/Cr ___ during this 
hospitalization).

# Transaminitis
Patient with persistently and stably elevated alk phos.  He has 
had no obstructive
symptoms/abdominal pain concerning for biliary obstruction; FFT 
is wnl and RUQ US shows no evidence of obstruction.  Likely 
related to his untreated CLL.

# BPPV
Resolved.  No focal deficits on neurologic exam so no suspicion 
for central process at this time.  Resolved at time of 
discharge.  Meclizine was not administered in the setting of his 
renal dysfunction. 

# CLL: Not currently on treatment. Initially, some mild 
elevations in uric acid lead to some concern for tumor lysis 
syndrome, although his LDH was stable and other electrolytes 
WNL. He was initiated on allopurinol which was later 
discontinued given his deterioration in renal function. In 
conjunction with his outpatient oncologist, treatment of his CLL 
is being considered, but should be deferred until the resolution 
of the acute infection. At the recommendation of his oncologist, 
he should receive IVIG if IgG < 500, although IgG> 500 as 
measured this hospitalization.

# DIABETES MELLITUS
Decreased home levemir to 10u QHS given some asymptomatic 
hypoglycemia earlier during his hospitalization.  His home 
metformin was held given his renal dysfunction.

# HLD 
Home statin and gemfibrozil held in the setting of his elevated 
alk phos.

# DEPRESSION:
Continued on home venlafaxine

# HTN:
Home lisinopril held in setting ___

# TOXIC METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY:
Resolved.  Likely ___ acute illness (Legionella) and metabolic 
derangements related to renal failure during his ICU 
hospitalization.  Resolved while on the medical floor.

# DIARRHEA
Resolved.  Cdiff negative.

***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES***
- PPD negative
- Home lisinopril and metformin held in the setting of his renal 
dysfunction
- Home gemfibrozil and statin held in the setting of his alk 
phos elevation (continue to monitor as outpatient)
- Patient to follow-up with his primary oncologist for ongoing 
management of his CLL (untreated, not a new diagnosis, WBC has 
been stably in the 180s-240s over the past year)
- Patient to follow-up with his new nephrologist Dr. ___ 
at ___ within 2 weeks
- Please check Chem10 every 2 days and make sure that all 
medications are renally dosed (in particular levofloxacin)
- Anticipated end date of levofloxacin is ___ (total 21 day 
course)
- HCP is brother, Dr. ___ (___).
