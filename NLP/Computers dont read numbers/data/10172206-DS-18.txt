age-related involutional with chronic microangiopathic changes 
without acute hemorrhage or mass effect. 
  
Moderate narrowing of the proximal left cavernous ICA just 
beyond it's exit of the petrous segment. Otherwise unremarkable 
CTA of the head and neck without evidence of significant 
stenosis, aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, or dissection.   
  
Enlarged main pulmonary artery which may reflect pulmonary 
hypertension.   
  
Asymmetric soft tissue fullness about the right piriform sinus

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with DM2, COPD, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF ___ 
s/p dual chamber ICD, CAD s/p MI ___ ___ and 3V CABG (LIMA-LAD 
and separate SVGs to fist diag and right PLVB), and hx of 
cocaine use who presents s/p cardiac arrest ___ the setting of VT 
storm, now found to have L occipital/parietal watershed infarct. 


# Cardiac arrest: Patient presented to OSH with VT storm s/p 
close to 60 total ICD shocks, multiple rounds of CPR with 
unclear down/pulseless time. Differential for VT could be 
cocaine abuse, hypokalemia, new or worsened heart failure, and 
acute myocardial ischemia. Initial antiarrythmics included IV 
Amiodarone and IV Lidocaine. Per EP recommendations, lidocaine 
was weaned off and amiodarone was continued. Patient treated 
with cooling protocol given comatose state after ROSC. He was 
successfully extubated on ___ and was switched to PO Amiodarone, 
now on maintenance dose. Metoprolol and Lisinopril were titrated 
during admission. He had a few episodes of NSVT but no further 
significant arrhythmias with optimization of fluid and 
electrolyte status. He underwent an ICD generator change on 
___. He was started on Vancomycin IV s/p generator change for a 
10d course and transitioned to PO Clindamycin given concern for 
possible rash/itchiness - pt w/ hx of MRSA. Will need follow up 
with EP for consideration of VT ablation. 

# Heart failure: Patient has severe biventricular heart failure 
(EF ___ with BiV/ICD. He is on medical management with 
lisinopril and metoprolol. Following aggressive diuresis of 
pulmonary edema, he is being continued on PO lasix 20mg daily. 
Continued on aspirin and statin for history of CAD s/p MI and 
now stroke. Repeat TTE ___ 3 months to eval ventricular function.

# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: ABG 7.___/112/23 on 
admission. Patient with bilateral infiltrates on CXR with P:F 
92. Likely due to pulmonary edema and significantly improved 
with aggressive diuresis. There was an interval concern for 
pneumonia and he was treated on a 7d course of Vancomycin and 
Cefepime. Sputum cultures grew only commensal flora. He was 
successfully extubated on ___ and had no further respiratory 
issues. 

#Stroke/AMS: With weaning of sedation, patient was found to have 
preferential movement of left side without significant right 
side movement. Found to have interval development of L 
occipital/parietal watershed infarction on CT (___). Deficits 
predominantly of right side neglect and NOT right hemiparesis as 
originally thought (exam confounded by right side neglect). CTA 
of head/neck showed moderate narrowing of proximal L cavernous 
ICA. EEG was abnormal with non-specific encephalopathy and focal 
dysfunction ___ L temporal region, but no epileptiform 
discharges. He showed interval improvement ___ neurological 
status and was able to sit unassisted, feed himself with his 
left hand and stand/walk with minimal assistance. He will need 
ongoing ___ rehabilitation. He was medically managed 
with aspirin, statin and permissive hypertension. He was 
maintained on quetiapine BID and lorazepam PRN for agitation. He 
should have follow up with Neurology for ongoing management. 

# Acute kidney injury: Cr 1.8 on admission (unknown baseline) ___ 
a patient with assumed baseline renal insufficiency likely due 
to DM. Initial acute increase ___ creatinine (peak Cr 3.9) likely 
due to poor forward flow ___ setting of EF of 20% and hypotension 
related to cooling process with contribution from distributive 
shock/sepsis. Resolved with improvement ___ clinical status and 
now below admission value at 0.9-1.1.

# DM: Glucose 400s on admission, patient managed with ISS and 
normoglycemic throughout stay. 

# Aneurysmal LV: Was initially on heparin gtt, switched to 
Lovenox and bridged to warfarin. Will need Warfarin x 3months.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# The patient was deemed to not currently have capacity for 
medical decision making, as he is not consistently oriented to 
place or situation, cannot articulate his condition or decisions 
that are being asked of him.  His brother ___ (___) 
has been appointed his Health Care Proxy. 
# Full Code per discussion with HCP and pt, as patient recovers 
cognitive function.
# Clindamycin 300mg TID for total of 1 week of antibiotics at 
time of DC, first day ___. 
# Continue titration of warfarin for INR goal 2.0-3.0 x3 months.
# Repeat LFTs ___ 1 month s/p initiation of statin given slight 
LFT elevations during admission (ALT 50, AST 44).
# Amiodarone: Will need PFTs as outpt, TSH during admission wnl.
# TTE should be ordered ___ 3 month to eval ventricular function.
# Follow up with EP Dr ___ ___ ___ for device management 
and consideration for VT ablation
# Follow up with Neurology for post-stroke management.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. You were admitted 
for treatment of your arrhythmia (an irregular heart beat). ___ 
this setting you suffered a cardiac arrest and required CPR and 
medications to restore your heart beat and blood pressure. You 
remained ___ a medical coma and and required a breathing tube 
until your respiratory status improved. We treated your 
arrhythmia with medications. We also performed a battery change 
for your internal defibrillator. 

It is also very important that you avoid illegal drugs at they 
can cause changes ___ your heart rhythm which can lead to another 
episode of your heart stopping.  Please take all your 
medications as prescribed.

You were also treated for heart failure with medications. Heart 
failure is the inability for the heart to meet the needs of the 
body. We have changed your medicaitons and your heart failure 
symtpoms have continued to improve along with careful monitoring 
of your diet and fluid intake. 

You were also diagnosed and treated for pneumonia with a course 
of antibiotics which has resolved. 

You also suffered from a stroke. Your funcitoning has continued 
to improve and you will be followed by a nueurologist as an 
outpatient.

You were found to have an anurysm ___ the left ventricle of your 
heart which puts you at increased risk for another stroke so you 
have been placed on Coumadin. It is very important that you take 
your Coumadin exactly as directed (every evening, dose will be 
adjusted by Dr. ___ and take blood tests to ensure 
that it is working appropriately.  The rehab facility will 
manage your Coumadin levels.
