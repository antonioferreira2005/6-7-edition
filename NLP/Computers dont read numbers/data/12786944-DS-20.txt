Imaging:
Images:  
___ Lumbo-sacral plain films: There are five non-rib-bearing 
vertebral bodies. Vertebral body heights are relatively flat and 
slightly bullet-shaped. No frank compression fracture is 
detected. Disc heights are preserved, except for mild narrowing 
at L1 through L3. No spondylolisthesis is detected. Mild facet 
arthrosis is present.  Compared with ___ and allowing for 
technical differences, I doubt significant interval change. 
Rounded density overlying the upper left SI joint likely 
represents a bridging osteophyte. 
  IMPRESSION: No acute fracture detected in the lumbar spine. 
Background degenerative changes are similar to ___ 
.
___ CT Abdomen:
1. No signs of bleeding are identified. 
2. Liver cirrhosis with secondary portal hypertension signs that 
include splenomegaly and portosystemic shunts and ascites. 
3. Stable portal vein thrombus.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:  ___ year old male with PSC cirrhosis on the transplant 
list, portal vein thrombosis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and 
recent admission for chostrochondritis admitted from clinic for 
back pain. 
.  
# Back pain:  Extensive work-up negative, with no evidence of 
fracture, infection.  No neurological compromise to suggest cord 
involvement.  Most likely to be musculoskeletal sprain/strain 
given clinical picture, including positional nature, improvement 
with lidoderm patch and heat packs, and chronically distended 
abdomen which likely causes increased strain on his lower back.  
 
.
# Leukocytosis:  This was a new finding for the patient.  An 
infectious work-up was negative, incluidng UA, BCx, CXR, and 
ascites negative for SBP.  Most likely to represent 
glucocorticoid effect, and should be followed up as an 
outpatient.  Pain was managed with oxycodone, heat packs, 
lidoderm patches (12 hours on, 12 hours off), and tylenol.  
Standing tylenol was stopped for LFT elevations beyond baseline.
.
#PSC cirrhosis: Complicated by portal vein thrombosis, varices, 
refractory ascites, SBP.  500cc paracentesis done on ___ 
negative for SBP.  Continued Ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis; 
lactulose, rifaximin, ursodiol, and cholestryramine.  Regarding 
diuretics, spironolactone was continued, but lasix was stopped, 
and torsemide started.  This change was made due to possibility 
of lasix leading to the patient's leukocytoclastic vasculitis 
(see below).  
.
#Portal vein thrombosis: On coumadin: INR subtherapeutic on 
admission:
INR 1.7 --> given 2mg
INR 1.6 --> given 3mg
INR 1.9 --> given 2mg
Next INR due ___.
.  
#Petichiae: Patient with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.  It is 
possible that the petichiae this admission are secondary to 
thrombocytopenia and liver disease, however could not exclude 
LCV.  The patient's LCV has been refractory to prednisone, with 
recurrence of the lesions when dose gets to 25mg daily.  
Rheumatology was consulted, and recommended a slower taper (40mg 
x1wk; 35mg x1wk; 30mg x1wk; 25mg x1wk, etc).  They did not feel 
a biologic steroid-sparing agent was indicated, in this patient 
with chronic liver disease.  It was felt on a previous admission 
that cephalosporins were the triggering medication.  After a 
review of the literature, lasix is another potential culprit 
medication.  Subsequently, lasix was stopped and torsemide 
started for diuresis.  Other etiologies like cryoglobulinemia, 
ANCA + vasculitidies were ruled out on previous admission.  It 
was not felt by the primary team or by rheumatology that there 
was any connection between the vasculitis and the back pain.  
C3, C4, ESR, CRP were checked and were at patient's baseline.  
Given the patient's potential reaction to lasix, Pentamadine was 
used for PCP ___ (1 dose given on ___ in lieu of 
bactrim.
.
# ___:  Patient had transient elevation in creatinine that 
improved back to baseline Cr 0.8-0.9 without significant 
intervention.  FeUrea 42% was not particularly suggestive of 
either pre-renal or intrinsic renal cause.
.
# Transaminitis: Chronic, secondary to PSC.  LFTs were increased 
beyond patient's baseline this admission, but stable at the time 
of discharge.  Likely medication effect, and will need outpt 
follow-up.
.
# Hyponatremia: Patient was placed on a PO fluid restriction, 
and sodium was stable at the time of discharge
.
# Thrombocytopenia: likely splenic sequestration. Stable.
# Anemia:  Chronic and stable. No evidence for blood loss during 
this admission.
# Depression: continued citalopram.
# GERD: Continued PPI
.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Lasix stopped; torsemide started 
-Lidocaine patches started

admission

5mg each week 
___ INR 1.7 --> given 2mg

Next INR due ___. Goal INR ___ for portal vein 
thrombosis

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for back pain.  It is likely that this pain is 
caused by an injury to the muscles of your lower back.  It is 
important to exercise daily, which is key in the healing process 
(which may take several weeks).  In addition to the lidoderm 
patches (12 hours on, 12 hours off each day) you should use 
heating pads to help with the pain.
.
We also did a paracentesis and removed the fluid from your 
belly.
.
Please follow-up with your outpatient physicians as scheduled 
below
