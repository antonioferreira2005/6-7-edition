evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.
 
ABDOMEN:
 
HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation 
throughout. 
There is no evidence of focal lesions.  There is no evidence of

peripancreatic
stranding.
 
SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, 
without
evidence of focal lesions.
 
ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size 
and shape.
 
URINARY: The patient is status post cystectomy, with right lower 
quadrant
ileal conduit.  There is an unchanged degree of ureteral 
fullness bilaterally,
consistent with chronic reflux.  The right kidney appears 
shrunken and
atrophic, and demonstrates a delayed nephrogram, similar to 
prior. 
Heterogeneous enhancement of the left kidney has the appearance 
of a striated
nephrogram, which is concerning for pyelonephritis.  
Furthermore, there is
mild left perinephric stranding.  Several punctate 
nonobstructing stones are
seen in the right kidney.  There is mild stranding is seen 
surrounding the
right ureter, similar to prior.
 
GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable.  Small bowel 
loops demonstrate
normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout.  The 
colon and
rectum are within normal limits.  The appendix is normal.
 
PELVIS:  Status post cystectomy.  Coarse calcifications are seen 
within the
prostate gland.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
 
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The reproductive organs are unremarkable.
 
LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy.  There
is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
 
VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Mild 
atherosclerotic disease
is noted.
 
BONES:  The pelvis appears dysmorphic, with spina bifida and 
meningomyelocele.
 
SOFT TISSUES: Note is made of right parastomal hernia that 
contains the ileal
conduit.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1. Striated nephrogram and mild perirenal stranding on the left 
is concerning
for pyelonephritis.
2. Status post cystectomy with right lower quadrant ileal 
conduit.  Unchanged
degree of ureteral fullness bilaterally, consistent with chronic 
reflux.  Mild
stranding is seen surrounding the right ureter, unchanged.
3.  Several punctate nonobstructing stones are seen in the right 
kidney.
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ M h/o spina bifida, neurogenic bladder s/p ileal conduit 
urostomy with chronic hydronephrosis and recurrent UTI sometimes 
with pyelonephritis, presenting with fever, nausea, and chronic 
right flank ___ in the setting of severe sepsis with left 
pyelonephritis.

#Severe sepsis and left hydronephrosis: 
Febrile, tachycardic, and intermittently hypotensive, with 
normal lactate. The most likely source is his urine as his CT 
abd is indicative of pyelo. UA is difficult to analyze due to 
urostomy bag. Other possible sources of sepsis include LLE 
lesion and coccygeal ulcer. Blood cultures were negative and 
urine cx grew mixed flora, however given his clinical 
presentation, CT findings and micro history including resistant 
pathogens, opted to treat empirically with meropenem. He was 
stabilized and transferred to medical floor on the night of 
___. He was febrile that night but subsequently defervesced and 
remained hemodynamically stable. HIs antihypertensives were held 
as he remained normotensive. 

# acute on chronic right flank ___:
He continued to report severe right flank ___, acute on 
chronic, on the opposite side of his known pyelonephritis. He 
has had this ___ for ___ years, and he reports acute exacerbation 
whenever he is hospitalized with a UTI. He appears very 
comfortable, working on his mobile phone, eating, talking to his 
wife at bedside, and still reports severe ___. There is no 
clear etiology for this ___, which I have discussed with him at 
length during prior admissions, and I explained this is likely 
neuropathic ___. Neuropathic ___ has been associated with 
spina bifida. He is on high doses of narcotics, and he reports 
"they don't even touch the ___ As such, there is no reason to 
continue these narcotics, and narcotics have been shown to be 
ineffective in the management of neuropathic ___. Ultimately he 
should be weaned off them, but this is deferred to his 
outpatient physician in the ___ Clinic Dr ___. In 
addition, there is no indication for IV narcotics, which he 
requested. I started Mr ___ on gabapentin during a prior 
admission, and I asked if this helped. He said he doesnt recall, 
nor does he recall if he had any adverse effect which led to 
their discontinuation. OMR was reviewed including notes from 
___ Svc, and there is no documented reason why gabapentin was 
discontinued. There was documented good response to ultram. I 
paged Dr ___ to discuss, and pt agreed to try gabapentin and 
ultram again. Gabapentin was slowly titrated up, with further 
titration deferred to the outpatient setting. On the day of 
discharge, he continued to report uncontrolled ___, but he was 
stable to continue ___ mgmt in the outpt setting.

# bilateral upper extremity DVT, dx ___: 
Pt was maintained on warfarin with close monitoring INR while on 
abx. Standard of care is three mos anticoagulation, as the 
source of thrombus was removed. Howevere, since a midline was 
placed for another course abx, the decision was made to extend 
anticoagulation for another two weeks until midline is removed. 
Warfarin can be discontinued at that point. Discussed with pt, 
who expressed understanding and agreement. 

#Spina bifida:
- Continue baclofen

# hypertension:
As noted above, antihypertensives were held since he presented 
with severe sepsis and hypotension. He remained normotensive on 
the medical floor, and antihypertensives were not restarted at 
the time of discharge. He is to f/u with PCP to address 
when/whether these should be restarted.
