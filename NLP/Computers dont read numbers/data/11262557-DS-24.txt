Chief Complaint:
failure to thrive, altered mental status 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
___ w/ hx of ESRD s/p renal transplant on tacro and MMF, 
paroxysmal A fib, endocarditis s/p prosthetic AVR/MVR, recent 
admission for MSSA septic R knee arthritis s/p washout who 
presents as a transfer from ___ for worsening altered 
mental status, electrolyte abnormalities, and failure to thrive. 


Pt was first hospitalized at ___ in mid ___ for a septic knee, 
and underwent washout. Initially treated with cefazolin/rifampin 
with joint retention strategy, rifampin later d/c'ed given 
significant drug interactions with warfarin/tacro. Re-admitted 
to ___ on ___ for AMS, hypoxemia, shoulder and knee pain. 
Found to have pulmonary edema thought to be ___ fludricort 
administration for heparin-induced hyperkalemia/hyponatremia 
prior to admission. Oxygen requirement improved with diuresis. L 
shoulder and L knee were noted to have effusions, and no 
definitive dx was made after workup by rheum. He was followed by 
ID, who suggested patient switch from cefazolin to levofloxacin 
suppresion for six months. Electrolyte abnormalities included 
hyperkalemia thought to be ___ tacrolimus toxicity, hyponatremia 
___ known history of SIADH, and hypercalemia ___ tertiary 
hyperparathyroidism. Also found to have BK viremia. Pt was 
discharged back to ___ on ___ where he developed 
worsening delirium, persistent electrolyte abnormalities 
(hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia), and decreased PO 
intake with recent 5 pound weight loss in past 5 days 
(119-->114). He was subsequently transferred back to the floor 
as a direct admit. 

Here, he is AxO x3, and states that he has an appetite but 
doesn't enjoy the foot at ___. Family reports mental 
status has worsened over past week with patient rambling more, 
and making non-sequitor statements. Also endorse that he only 
appears to eat if they are sitting there watching him. He 
endorses chills, night sweats though denies nausea, vomiting, 
urinary or bowel symptoms, fevers, chest pain, dyspnea. Does 
feel that he is more confused than he was before his first 
admission for knee washout.  Patient denies cough, but family 
does report noticing cough today.

MICRO
Blood Culture (___): No Growth
Urine Culture (___): < 10 000 organisms

IMAGING
Head CT w/contrast (___)
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or enhancing 
lesion.  
2.  Small amount of fluid in the mastoid air cells inferiorly on 
both sides. 
3.  Mottled density of the skull bones - can relate to a 
combination of osteopenia, prominence of the vascular structures 
within or marrow changes, similar to prior. 
4.  Extensive intra and extracranial vascular calcification as 
before. 

Chest AP (___)
Mild pulmonary edema has improved since ___.  Moderate 
cardiomegaly is chronic.  Patient has had median sternotomy and 
aortic and mitral valve replacements.  No appreciable pleural 
abnormality.  Incidental note is made of an azygos fissure, a 
common anatomic variant. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ hx of ESRD s/p renal transplant on cyclosporine and MMF, 
paroxysmal A fib on coumadin, endocarditis s/p AVR/MVR, recent 
admission for hypoxemia, altered mental status s/p MSSA septic R 
knee arthritis washout who was managed for altered mental status 
and failure to thrive. 

# AMS: AMS was thought to be secondary to delirium given waxing 
and waning presentation. Possible etiologies of AMS initially 
included infectious vs metabolic (history of many electrolyte 
abnormalities) vs structural (hospital, ___ vs 
medication-induced (olanzapine, levofloxacin). Patient's mental 
status waxed and waned over hospital. Full infectious workup was 
unremarkable aside from mild BK viremia, which renal felt was 
non-contributory. Patient was found to have hypercalcemia, 
though hypercalcemia of 11.2 was not thought to be high enough 
to cause altered mentation. Vitamin D level returned normal. 
Patient's home Cinacalcet dose was increased. Olanzapine was 
discontinued per psych recs. Renal adjusted transplant 
medications to minimize neurotoxicity: tacrolimus was switched 
to cyclosporine. Structural causes as a result of the patient 
being in the hospital ___ for the past month and a half 
are likely contributing. CT head revealed fluid in the mastoid 
cells though did not elucidate any pathology that may be 
contributing to patient's mental status. Patient's mental status 
improved near the end of his hospital course.

#Failure to Thrive 
Patient had experienced 5lb weight loss in 5 days (119-->114) 
before presenting to the floor. Wait loss likely due to 
significantly decreased PO intake. Had Dohboff previously though 
pulled and refused replacement. Patient endorsed loss of 
appetite due to food quality at ___. Initial differential 
for failure to thrive included infection vs ongoing delirium vs 
depression contributing to decreased PO intake. Patient admitted 
that he was depressed to multiple team members. Of note, patient 
was sent to ___ was for evaluation for G tube placement. ID was 
consulted and concluded that an infectious source was unlikely. 
Patient was started on nystatin solution. Psych increased the 
patient's Mirtazapine to 15mg and then 30mg qhs to help with 
sleep and appetite. Ortho came by and cut away a retained suture 
on patient's right knee, and a repeat radiograph showed no 
changes from prior. Ortho did not feel knee was nidus for 
infection. GI was consulted, and recommended doing calorie 
counts, which revealed consumption of around 1300 calories per 
day. The patient was initially amenable to G tube, however soon 
thereafter began refusing it. Given refusal, G tube placement 
was deferred, and patient was placed on Megace with plan to d/c 
to rehab.

# Hyponatremia: Patient's electrolytes were wnl upon 
presentation to floor. The patient has a history of SIADH and 
had presented on a fluid restriction. Renal recommended 
liberalizing restriction in an attempt to get the patient to eat 
more. The patient subsequently developed a mild hyponatremia, 
which resolved on ___. Patient's malnourished state is likely 
also contributing to hyponatremia. Given the importance of PO 
intake, and very mild hyponatremia, the patient was kept off of 
fluid restriction, and his sodium was watched. Hyponatremia 
subsequently self-resolved.

#Hypoaldosteronism: Patient developed hypotension with 
concomitant hyperkalemia and hyponatremia in the late afternoon 
on ___. Likely secondary to heparin drip induced hypoaldo 
state. Patient was placed on 0.2mg fludricort with subsequent 
normalization of lab values and pressures.

# Periorbital/perinasal rash with pruritus: Patient reports that 
his eyes, nose and the area around it are chronically itchy. 
Erythematous papules on perinasal/periorbital area, mild L eye 
purulent discharge and conjunctivits. Differential included 
allergic contact dermatitis vs atopic dermatitis vs nutritional 
deficiency. Rash was treated with sarna lotion and 
triamcinolone. Conjunctivitis resolved without treatment.

# L knee effusion: Chronic L knee effusion, was worked up by 
rheum during previous admission. No obvious etiology though not 
thought to be RA/OA, a crystalline arthropathy, or septic. Was 
placed on levofloxacin for six months during prior admission in 
___. Levofloxacin was continued. 

Chronic Issues
# Anemia: Patient presented with chronic mildly 
microcytic/normocytic anemia. Anemia likely secondary to 
combination of nutritient deficiency from poor PO intake (Fe, 
folate, B12) +/- GI losses given h/o hemorrhoids and prior 
supratherapeutic INR. H and H during hospital course was at 
baseline. Patient's home iron was continued. 

# Renal Transplant ___ LURT: Patient was continued on 
mycophenolate and tacrolimus. Tacrolimus levels ranged from ___ 
during hospitalization. Tacrolimus was switched to cyclosporine 
on ___ in an attempt to minimize neurotoxicity. 

# AVR/MVR ___, paroxysmal afib. Patient is usually 
anticoagulated on coumadin. Was placed on a heparin drip at 
___ prior to admission due to subtherapeutic INR. Coumadin 
was held upon admission in case patient required G tube. It was 
restarted on ___. Patient was transitioned from his heparin 
drip to ___ for rehab placement.

# Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism: Patient's Cinacalcet dose was 
increased to 90mg qd given hypercalcemia i/s/o tertiary 
hyperparathyroidism.

# OSA, Sleep Disturbance: Patient's Mirtazapine dose was 
increased to 30mg qhs per psych.

# Dry Skin: Chronic issue, managed with continuation of home 
hydrocerin, ketoconazole, sarna lotion, triamcinolone. 

Transitional Issues
-transplant follow up given change in immunosuppressive regimen 
-fludricort will need to be tapered once patient is off of 
heparin drip
-rehab placement 
-goals of care discussion 
-need to ensure nutritional needs are met 
-follow up with neuro to evaluate potential contribution of 
chronic vascular changes seen on head CT 
-will need cyclosporine levels checked on ___ and faxed to 
___ at ___ (target level 100)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization 
at ___. You were admitted to the hospital for some altered 
thinking and poor nutritional intake. Our testing revealed that 
you did not have an infection, and an imaging study of your 
brain did not show anything concerning. Your labs were all 
within normal limits. A discussion was had between you and 
multiple different teams regarding potential G tube placement 
given your malnourished state. It was ultimately concluded not 
to go forward with the tube, and you were discharged to a 
rehabilitation facility. 

We wish you the best!
