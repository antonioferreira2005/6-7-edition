RADIOLOGY:

No acute cardiopulmonary process.

No acute intraabdominal process.

No acute intracranial process.

ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
___
Poor image quality. The left atrium is elongated. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size 
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal 
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not 
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of 
panhypopituitarism who presents with vasodilatory shock in the 
setting of likely adrenal crisis precipitated by influenza.
  

# Shock: Patient presenting with shock likely secondary to 
adrenal crisis in setting of influenza A infection. Patient was 
fluid resuscitated, given stress dose steroids, and covered 
initially with broad-spectrum antibiotics, oseltamivir, and 
acyclovir. She initially required pressors for BP support. 
Pressors were discontinued on HD#1. A LP was performed which was 
unremarkable, thus acyclovir was discontinued. CT head, abdomen, 
and CXR were unremarkable. Patient was found to be (+) for 
influenza A on respiratory viral swab and influenza likely 
precipitated her adrenal crisis.  She will continue a 7 day 
course of oseltamivir 75 mg BID (first day ___. Endocrinology 
was consulted who provided recommendations about her treatment 
course. Endocrinology recommended a steroid taper as follows: 
hydrocortisone 50 mg IV Q8H x24 hrs, 25 mg IV Q8H x24 hrs, 
prednisone 10 mg x3 days followed by 5 mg x3 days then back to 
home dose of prednisone 3 mg daily.  Patient was called out to 
the medical floor on ___ and her blood pressures remained 
stable in the 110s-120s. Antibiotics (vanco/cefepime) were 
discontinued on ___ given cultures were negative to date and 
patient had no evidence of focal infection besides influenza.  
down to 25 mg iv q8 x24 hs today, then hydrocortisone 40mg am, 
20 mg pm, then resume home dose).  

# Adrenal Crisis: In context of patient's panhypopituitarism, 
her hypotension likely represents an adrenal crisis precipitated 
by influenza infection. She was followed by endocrine who 
recommended stress dose steroid taper as above. Patient was 
advised to obtain Medical Bracelet for AI. Patient was 
prescribed Solucortef 100 mg injection IM prescription at the 
time of discharge for medical emergency.  
Patient and family educated by endocrine team re: importance of 
having access to prednisone when ill and not missing doses 
(doubling instead) when ill.
  
# Panhypopituitarism:  Patient was continued on home 
levothyroxine and received stress dose steroids as above. She 
received a Solucortef 100 mg injection IM prescription at the 
time of discharge for medical emergency.  

# ___: Patient presenting with elevated creatinine likley 
secondary to vasodilatory shock. Her creatinine downtrended to 
normal with IVF.

# Transaminitis: Patient presenting with a transaminitis most 
consistent with hypotension. Enzymes trended down without 
intervention.
