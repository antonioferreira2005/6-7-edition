History of Present Illness:
___ y/o single white male, student at
___, complex PPH notable for anxiety and
psychosis, presenting brought in by his RA with change in mental
status, with insomnia and confused thinking as most prominent
symptoms. 

Pt was recently admitted here and followed by C/L service. He 
was
found to be grossly psychotic with concern for mania on initial
eval. He was treated with Zyprexa and this apparently had good
effect as his symptoms markedly improved within ___ days. He was
initially placed on ___ and ultimately discharged home.
However, it appears he had akathisia vs. dystonic reaction to 
the
Zyprexa and this was discontinued in the hospital prior to his
discharge. Apparently pt was discharged home on only his prior
home meds Paxil and klonopin without any antipsychotic. 

Pt is unable to give me clear history of how he has been doing
since then, but does say he has not slept in the past 3 days. He
also describes several recent stressors including his family
being more involved and perhaps overly involved in his life. 
Says
his sister recently told him she was raped by their father when
they were younger and there is much conflict between he and his
father about this. Also recently was rejected for a date with
someone he met online. Also describes arguing with his brother,
___, saying ___ is trying to tell him what to do. Describes
himself as "paranoid" and worried that people in his dorm are
talking about him. Last night overheard people in the common 
room
talking and came out to tell them to be quiet. ___ got involved
and said this was lucky as the other students were very 
irritated
with him. ___ then says the pt called him this morning and said 
he
had a "medical emergency."  pt then told ___ that he had not been
sleeping for 3 days and disclosed family/relationship problems 
to
him. ___ said the pt was behaving oddly, was "aggravated, tense
and suspicious," and so together they called pt's therapist as 
pt
was initially very reluctant to come to the ED. Per the RA, pt's
tone dramatically changed to even more tense and he began 
yelling
over the phone at his therapist. RA was with pt most of the
morning and even in the ED with him until I saw the pt. He says
throughout that time, pt has seemed "not in control of his
thoughts."  Says he has been "blurry and confused" and this is
not his baseline. However, the RA also says there was some time
before I saw pt where pt seemed much calmer and more like
himself. 

Pt is found by me to be quite odd and mostly confused. He has
great difficulty putting together a sentence. He stutters and
clenches his eyes tight as if intensely concentrating or in pain
and then what comes out is not a clear answer to the question. 
He
is unable to provide clear psychiatric ROS over the past week. 
He
told the ED resident that earlier this morning he had written an
email to his family saying he was going to kill himself, but did
not send the email. To me he says he is not suicidal, but does
not discuss the email. He has a difficult time even describing
his mood or what his thoughts/worries are about. He denies
specific "racing" thoughts but does admit that it is hard for 
him
to organize his thoughts. When asked re voices, says he does 
hear
his own voice often "weighing pros and cons of things" but does
not hear the voice of another.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Legal - The patient was admitted on a ___ from the ED 
and signed a CV on admission. 

2. Medical - There were no acute medical issues during his 
hospitalization. TSH was noted to be mildly elevated upon 
admission. There was a question of urinary retention at times, 
but each time resolved spontaneously and seemed most likely due 
to anxiety. At time of discharge, no longer had urinary 
concerns. His T3/T4 were WNL. 

3. Psychiatric - Upon admission, the patient's diagnosis was 
initally unclear as his behavior and mental status were odd and 
bizarre at times and inconsistent. He was very difficult to 
engage in conversation, at times limited either by questionable 
thought disorganization or by irritability/anger. He would 
frequently growl, grunt or make barking noises that were 
frightening to other patients and staff at times. Thus, he was 
initally maintained on 1:1 sitter in the quiet room, as he would 
not listen to staff redirection and required "someone in 
uniform" to keep his behavior contained. He would also 
frequently stand and walk with astasia abasia and do odd 
movements like covering his mouth as if to vomit without 
complaining of nausea or actually vomit. In the beginning he had 
marked difficulty communicating, as he would stutter and say a 
few words then shake his head in frustration and try again, but 
could never answer questions directly. At times, he would speak 
in full sentences and play the piano with great skill while 
other times was seen to roll around the floor of the quiet room. 
 He would occasionally make statements consistent with paranoid 
psychosis, such as "I know my mother and brother are patients in 
the hospital" and asking if there were cameras in the quiet 
room. Ultimatley with the constellation of symptoms of paranoia, 
auditory hallucinations, bizzare and disorganzied behavior, very 
poor sleep, Psychomotor agitation, racing thoughts, and the 
sudden onset of anger, irritability, low frustration tolerance, 
impulsivity, distractibility, poor concentration, and 
hypervigilence (from his baseline of being anxious, depressed, 
reserved), but a history of ___ distinct episodes of behavioral 
change, it was felt that his most likely diagnosis bipolar 
disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features. 

    In terms of psychopharmacology management, his home Paxil 
medication was tapered off given concern for mania and family 
concern that it had adverse effects on him. Benzos were also 
discontinued given concern for possible disinhibition 
contributing to his childlike/regressed manner. Due to history 
of dystonia on Zyprexa and question of akathesia on Abilify, he 
was started on Seroquel and then ultimately Seroquel XR, the 
dosage was titrated up to 800 mg po qhs with good effect. As it 
was titrated up, the patient showed significant improvement in 
clarity of thinking and speech, feel less overwhelmed, and have 
more relaxed and appropriate behavior, his psychotic symptoms 
resolved, he slept well and he and his family felt his symptoms 
resolved by time of discharge. He at no point was suicidal or 
homicidal. At time of discharge he was future oriented and 
looking forward to his summer. The patient was provided with 
education about the importance of close psychiatric follow up 
and continuing to take his medications when he leaves the 
hospital. The risk of sedation and metabolic side effects were 
explained and he understood this. At time of dischagre he was 
return with his parents to his ___ of ___ 
for additional support. Ultimatley he will be returning to 
___ to continue his studies. 

Over the course of admission psychological testing was completed 
as it had been during a prior hospitalization ___ years ago. 
Testing revealed prominent features of anxiety, obsessive, and 
dependent traits. At his baseline, the patient struggles with 
this chronically and will continue to work with his therapist in 
regards to this. He has a feeling that his history of home 
schooling and social isolation has impacted his ability to 
relate to his peers at school. Over the course of his admission 
the question of being on the Asperger's specturm was raised, but 
it was felt that this could not be adequately evaluated in the 
context of his acute mania. His mother reports that he never had 
developmental delay, never was evaluated by physicians until he 
began college. 

4. Social/Milieu: at time of dischagre patient was attending 
groups and was appropriatley participaing. 

5. Family work: over the course of his admission his care was

provided.
