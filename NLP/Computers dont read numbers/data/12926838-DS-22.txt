EKG
=============
EKG ___: AV paced, ventricular rate of 72

PRIOR IMAGING:
==================
# TTE ___: 
IMPRESSION: EF 55+% Normal global and regional biventricular 
systolic function. Severe left ventricular diastolic 
dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Severe pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension with evidence of RV volume/pressure 
overload.  

NEW IMAGING:  
===================
# CXR PA/Lat ___: 
IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions and enlarged 
cardiac silhouette. Pulmonary vascular congestion.  

# CT abd/pelv w/ contrast ___: 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No acute intra-abdominal process, specifically, no acute 
appendicitis.   
2.  New bilateral small pleural effusions with overlying 
atelectasis and a small pericardial effusion.   
3.  Unchanged hyperdense right lower pole renal lesion which is 
again 
concerning for malignancy.  A multiphasic CT or MRI is again 
recommended.   
4.  Unchanged large right adnexal cyst. 

# CT Head w/o contrast ___: 
FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute intracranial 
hemorrhage, midline 
shift, mass effect, or acute large vascular territorial infarct. 
 Gray-white matter differentiation is preserved.  There is 
prominence of the ventricles and sulci consistent with 
age-related global parenchymal loss.  Periventricular and 
subcortical white matter hypodensities bilaterally are most 
consistent with sequela of chronic small vessel disease, and may 
be minimally increased as compared to the prior study.  Minimal 
mucosal thickening is seen in the ethmoid air cells and in the 
left frontal sinus.  The remainder of the visualized paranasal 
sinuses and the mastoid air cells are clear.  No acute fracture 
is seen. 

IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.  Chronic changes, as 
above.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ a PMH significant for ___ (severe LAE, EF 55%, pHTN), 
Atrial fibrillatin (on coumadin) with sick sinus syndrome s/p 
dual chamber PPM who presents with altered mental status from 
metabolic encephalopathy from Acute Rehab facility. Her hospital 
course was significant for a negative infectious work-up and 
mild CHF exacerbation. 

# Metabolic Encephalopathy: 
Last seen normal on ___. Unclear what triggered AMS 
etiology. NCHCT without signs of acute bleed. CT Abd/Pelvis 
without signs of abcess as patient is recently s/p ruptured 
appendicitis. CXR with small bilateral pleural effusions. 
Infectious work-up for AMS was negative. She was persistently 
A&Ox1-2 (does not know location or date), but her attention was 
good, able to count days and months backward. She was discharged 
at what appears to be her baseline, which may be early dementia. 


# Atrial Fibrillation on warfarin: 
CHADS2 score of 3 (CHF, HTN, Age). On coumadin as outpatient. 
Subtherapeutic INR for at least 10 days prior to admission. INR 
1.3 on ___ at Rehab.  Warfarin was increased to 6. She was 
continued on her home dose of Metoprolol. 

# HFPEF: 
Mr. ___ appeared slightly volume overloaded on exam and had 
imaging significant for bilateral pleural effusions with a small 
pericardial effusion on CT. Last echo on ___ showed EF 55+%. 
Her admission wt is 84kg. She received Lasix 40mg IV x2 with 
good diuresis. She appeared more euvolemic on the day of 
discharge although her weight was 85.6 kg (unclear if accurate). 
She was discharged on her home dose of metoprolol and torsemide. 


# RUE superficial thrombophlebitis
Arrived from ___ with slight warm, erythematous, tender indurated 
RUE IV site. Site was dramatically improved in 24 hours with 
warm compress. 
 
# Hypertension  
Continued on home Metoprolol and Lisinopril
 
# Hyperlipidemia  
Continued on home Atorvastatin

# Sick sinus syndrome with pacemaker
AV paced on admission w/ baseline EKG.  

# Leukopenia
WBC 3.1 on day of discharge. Patient without signs or symptoms 
of infection. Would monitor as an outpatient. 

# Normocytic Anemia
Hg ___. At baseline. 

# Hyponatremia
Na stable during admission, but 130 on day of discharge. Likely 
due to diuresis. Would follow-up as outpatient. 

# AST elevation
Seems chronic. Would monitor as an outpatient. 

Transitional Issues
===============================
# Needs f/u with surgery for evaluation s/p ruptured appy
# Needs f/u with Cardiology for CHF: FYI, patient had small 
pericardial effusion on CT
# Needs follow up with PCP: ___ monitor weight, WBC, anemia, 
AST elevation, and right lower pole renal lesion (found on CT. 
would recommend multiphasic CT or MRI). 
# Needs blood draw on ___ for CBC, INR. Please titrate 
Coumadin to INR ___. Please continue to monitor WBC count as 
patient was discharged with WBC 3.1. 
# CONTACT: ___ (daughter) ___  
# CODE: Full- confirmed
