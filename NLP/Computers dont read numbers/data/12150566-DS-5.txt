RADIOLOGY:
___ CT ABD:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Status post Whipple procedure, with heterogeneous hypodense 
areas 
throughout the left lobe of the liver and in segment 5 
concerning for 
necrosis. 
2. Small pockets of fluid posterior to the gastrojejunostomy and 

hepaticojejunostomy, however no organized collection is noted. 
3. Mildly enlarged upper abdominal lymph nodes are mildly more 
prominent 
compared to prior. 
4. Limited evaluation of the lung bases shows small left pleural 
effusion.

___ RUE DOPPLER:
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Occlusive thrombus of the right axillary vein. 
2.  Nonocclusive thrombi in the right subclavian and basilic 
veins. 
3.  No organized fluid collection in the area of concern by the 
patient in the right ventral forearm where there is bruising. 
 
___ ECHO:
Conclusions   
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully 
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations or clinically-significant 
valvular disease seen. Normal global and regional biventricular 
systolic function. 

___ CT ABD:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Status post Whipple's procedure.  The position of the 
pancreatic duct stent has moved with the proximal tip noted just 
outside the main pancreatic duct.  Surrounding this, there are 
pockets of air without significant fluid collection. 
2. Fluid collection posterior to the hepaticojejunostomy appears 
more 
loculated with mild rim enhancement but does not demonstrate 
internal pockets of air.  This may represent a seroma or 
developing abscess. 
3. Rim enhancing fluid collection in the right hemiabdomen, 
intimately 
associated with the terminal ileum, demonstrates internal 
pockets of air and is suggestive of an abscess. 
4. Free fluid noted in the left hemiabdomen does not demonstrate 
loculation, rim enhancement or pockets of air to suggest 
abscess. 
5. Multiple enlarged periportal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes 
are unchanged. 
6. Heterogeneous enhancement of the left lobe of the liver is 
again noted and consistent with hepatic necrosis. 
7. Enlarging left pleural effusion.  New small right pleural 
effusion.

___ BILATERAL ___ DOPPLER:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins. 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient with duodenal mass was admitted to the Surgical 
Oncology Service for elective ___ procedure. On ___, the 
patient underwent standard pancreaticoduodenectomy with 
antecolic gastrojejunostomy, which went well (please see the 
Operative Note for details). Post operative lactate was 8, 
patient was transferred in ICU intubated on Neo gtt. Post op 
labs were noticeable for high LFTs and decreased HCT. On POD 2, 
patient was febrile to 102, LFTs continued to climb, patient was 
extubated. On POD 3, patient remained febrile, fever work up, 
LFTs started to downward. Patient's epidural was discontinued 
secondary to fever, patient was started on dilaudid PCA, Foley 
was discontinued. On POD 4, Foley was replaced secondary to 
acute urinary retention. Patient's diet was advanced to sips of 
clears. On POD 5, patient's diet was advanced to clears, she was 
transferred to the floor. On POD 6, patient's diet was advanced 
to regular, Foley was discontinued and patient voided. 
On POD 7, patient was noticed to have elevated WBC, tachicardic 
with maximum temperature 102.8. Patient was pan cultures. She 
underwent CT abdomen, which demonstrated hepatic necrosis, 
hepaticojejunostomy and gastrojejunostomy fluid collections. 
Patient was started on Zosyn, drain amylase was 6. 
On POD 8, patient developed acute onset of abdominal pain with 
tachycardia. Patient was transferred in ICU, started on 
Meropenem, Fluconazole. Ucx came back positive for Klebsiella 
and yeast. Drain output increased, JP amylase ___ concerning 
for pancreatic fistula. Fluconazole was changed to Micofungin 
per ID. Patient was transfused with 1 unit of pRBC for HCT 21.7. 
 
On POD 9, blood cultures from ___ positive for yeast. Patient 
was started on Octreotide secondary to increased drain output. 
Diet was advanced to sips, PICC line was placed and patient was 
started on TPN. Patient was transferred to the floor. 
On POD 10, Peritoneal fluid was positive for Enterobacter 
cloacae, antibiotics changed to Cefepime, Flagyl and Fluconazole 
per ID.  
On POD 11, patient was found swollen RUE. US revealed DVT. 
Patient PICC was removed, Heparin gtt was started, PPN was 
started. 
On POD 12, patient's diet was advanced to regular diabetic, 
staples were removed.
On POD 13, patient was noticed purulent leak from incision, 
bottom part of the wound was opened and packed with dry gauze 
dressing. Patient underwent abdominal CT, which demonstrated 
right hemiabdomen rim enhancing fluid collection, loculated 
hepatojejunostomy fluid, and left liver lobe necrosis (please 
see radiology report for details). Right arm PICC line was 
placed, TPN was restarted. 
On POD 14, ___ was consulted for possible drainage of 
intraabdominal fluid collection, which was feasible. Drainage 
was postponed as patient was clinically stable. Heparin gtt was 
discontinued, and therapeutic Lovenox was started. Wound opening 
was extended for better drainage. Cardioechogram and 
ophthalmology exam were negative for valvular vegetations or 
fungal endophthalmitis.
On POD 15, patient's diet was advanced to regular.
On POD 16, patient tolerated regular diabetic diet, remained 
afebrile with WBC slightly elevated. Patient was screened for 
rehabilitation. 
On POD 17, continued to do well, insulin was adjusted for better 
glycemic control.
On POD 18, patient's TPN was weaned off. 
On POD 19, wound VAC was placed instead of packing. 
On POD 20, wound VAC was malfunctioned secondary to thick 
output, VAC was changed back to dry dressing. Cefepime was 
changed to Cipro PO, PICC line was discontinued. Patient was 
discharged in rehabilitation in stable condition.     
By the systems:
Neuro: Required minimal pain medications
CV: Tachycardia improved, patient in NSR
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. CXR revealed left 
pulmonary effusion, home HCTZ restarted. 
GI: Patient tolerates regular diet, she continued on TPN. TPN 
can be weaned off if patient tolerates adequate PO intake. 
Continued on SC Octreotide. 
ID: On Cipro, Flagyl and Fluconazole for ___ fungemia, 
intraabdominal Enterobacter infection. Anticipated stop day 
___, ID will follow. 
Endocrine: Patient was followed by ___ and insulin 
dose was adjusted as needed. 
Hematology: Received one unit of RBC for anemia of chronic 
disease. HCT remained stablelow, no further transfusions were 
required. On Lovenox x ___VT.
