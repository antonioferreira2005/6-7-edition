ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Abdominal pain:
# Acute on chronic persistent nausea, vomiting:
# History of gastric bypass:
Ms. ___ presented with abd pain, N/V - which reportedly is

on CT scan, however KUB w/ contrast passing into ___ so not 
really obstructed.  Felt no need for surgery. 
   Due to persistent pain, GI was consulted and EGD was done 
without any remarkable findings. Normal mucosa visualized, 
biopsies taken  Colonoscopy was considered. however, pt 
expressed desire to have it done as outpt.  Able to tolerate PO 
(full breakfast) without significant challenges.  
   Differential included SIBO = less likely celiac, IBD, panc 
insufficiency.  Stool studies are pending STOOL: HPylori Stool 
Ag, elastase, calprotectin. BLOOD: celiac serologies, IgA as 
outpt.  She was ambulating and showed no clear evidence of 
distress.  She has also ambulated off the floor and been gone 
for an hour for need to smoke.  Informed that she has to stay in 
hospital. 

# Lower extremity edema:

hypoalbuminemia from malnutrition. She has no clear evidence of 
liver disease. DDx includes cardiac though BNP only mildly 
elevated (though could be falsely low in setting of obesity) vs. 
kidney disease - creatinine wnl though has proteinuria vs. 
venous insufficiency. ___ US in ___ was negative for DVT. TSH 
0.61.

elevated raising possibility of infection. WBC count also 
elevated though could be from prednisone.

# Hydronephrosis, obstructing ureteral stone
Incidentally found on CT A/P. Symptoms are not classic for renal 
colic. Creatinine is normal.  Will need outpatient urology 
work-up.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,
   It was a pleasure to look after you.  As you know, you were 
admitted with abdominal pain and concern for small bowel 
obstruction.  You had multiple tests which revealed that there 
was no obstruction and you had good passage of content through 
the whole intestine.   An upper endoscopy was done - which 
showed no clear abnormalities either.  Multiple blood/stool 
tests were sent - some of which are pending and can be followed 
up by your Primary care doctor.

   Please take the Augmentin (antibiotics) as prescribed to see 
whether this can address a possible small bowel bacterial 
overgrowth - which can account for most of your symptoms.   

   We wish you well and good health.

Your ___ team
