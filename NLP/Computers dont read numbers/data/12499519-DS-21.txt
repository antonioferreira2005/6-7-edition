Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service for 
management of his peripheral vascular disease.  On ___ the 
patient was taken for left femoral artery to tibial artery 
bypass jump graft with R-basilic vein (see operative report for 
details).  The procedure went well without difficulty. 
.
The patient was advanced along the pathway for lower extremity 
below knee bypass.  His postoperative course was uncomplicated. 
He initially had a drain in the right arm near the vein donor 
site, but this was removed prior to discharge without any 
issues. 
.
Transplant Nephrology was consulted for management of the 
patient's immunosuppressive drugs with respect to his previous 
kidney transplant.  The tacrolimus levels were monitored and the 
medication dosing was kept at the home dose.  The Bactrim and 
prednisone were continued as well.  
.
The patient had a low hematocrit to 25.7 on POD2 and was 
transfused 1 unit pRBC followed by IV Lasix.  The hematocrit 
rose appropriately but the creatinine also rose.  However, the 
creatinine did improve after giving IVF hydration.  Per the 
patient and his cardiologist, the patient had not been taking 
Lasix at home at the time of the surgery.  
.
The patient was stable at the time of discharge with no acute 
issues.  The patient understood the plan for care, and agreed.
