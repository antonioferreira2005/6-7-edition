worse since then. She notes headache, chills, no rigors, no 
lightheadedness. She notes the catheter was draining red liquid

bowel obstructions.

She says she has both pain and anxiety right now. She says she 
takes Xanax up to 3x a day.

IMAGING 
=======

___ KUB
FINDINGS:
 
There is a moderate amount of gas in the stomach and small bowel 
loops. Fecal
material is seen in the rectum. There is marked dilation of the 
sigmoid colon
which is increased from prior exam.
Supine assessment limits detection for free air; there is no 
gross
pneumoperitoneum.
Osseous structures are unremarkable.
Curvilinear metallic densities are seen again in the right 
hemiabdomen,
unchanged from previous studies.
There are no unexplained soft tissue calcifications or 
radiopaque foreign
bodies.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
Marked dilation of the sigmoid colon, increased from prior exam. 
Consider
contrast enhanced CT to evaluate for active disease.

___ KUB
FINDINGS: 
 
A moderate amount of gas is again noted in the stomach and 
proximal smallbowel. There is interval improvement of the 
dilated sigmoid colon when compared to the most recent study.  
Overall, there is a nonobstructive gas pattern. There is no free 
intraperitoneal air.
Osseous structures are unremarkable. Curvilinear metallic 
densities are seen again in the right hemiabdomen, unchanged 
from the previous study.
There are no unexplained soft tissue calcifications or 
radiopaque foreign bodies.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
Interval improvement of the sigmoid colon dilation.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female PMH of CVA (paraplegic with neurogenic 
voiding dysfunction), RA, lupus, possible Crohn's, chronic 
abdominal pain (multiple SBOs s/p subtotal colectomy), 
nephrolithiasis, DM2, anxiety, and depression, now s/p SPT 
replacement on ___ with new onset abdominal symptoms and pain 
concerning for complicated UTI. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
#Sepsis secondary to UTI
Patient with initial fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and 
recent instrumentation and UA concerning for ongoing urinary 
tract infection meeting sepsis criteria. Patient has had a 
multitude of various urinary tract infections previously 
including proteus and. e-coli. Most recent available culture on 
admission showed proteus resistant to keflex, started on 
cefepime to cover for this. Cultures from OSH showed E. Coli in 
the urine pan sensitive, and mixed flora from suprapubic ostomy 
swab that were sensitive to quinolone, so patient was switched 
to levofloxacin and sent home with oral levofloxcain to continue 
until ___.  Leukocytosis resolved with IVF and Antibiotics.   
Pt had improvement in symptoms and was tolerating po diet 
without difficulty by the time of discharge.

#Abdominal pain: 
#Lower back pain:
#Opiate related constipation
Patient has no abnormal findings of air on her OSH CT scan other 
than some fat stranding around SPT felt consistent with recent 
replacement. Urology was consulted in ED and during admission 
and saw no need for any surgical intervention. SPT looked clean, 
ostomy site with no evidence of active infection. She was given 
pain control initially with standing tylenol and IV dilaudid, 
dilaudid PCA. She was converted to PO oxycodone which was 
tapered down to 5mg q8h on discharge. She had a KUB on ___ 
which showed dilated sigmoid colon with large stool burden, but 
received methylnatrexone and had multiple BMs.  Repeat KUB 
showed improvement in dilation and symptoms improved. She was 
maintained on an aggressive bowel regimen. Oxybutinin was also 
added as patient likely having bladder spasm, and gabapentin 
added for non-opioid pain control to help taper down on opioid 
dose, given concerns for opioid induced constipation with h/o 
SBO.   Pt was educated about the importance of avoiding opiates 
and weaning down off oxycodone as soon as possible.

#Nutrition:
Patient taking poor PO intake with dry MM on admission. Intake 
improved over the course of the hospitalization.

#Anxiety: 
#Psych: 
#Insomnia 
Continued trazadone (home is 300 mg nightly, gave 150 mg), paxil 
continued 40 mg daily, amitriptyline 50mg QHS, continued 
alpraxolam 0.5 mg BID 

#DM2: 
Held home metformin 1000 mg BID, started ISS

TRANSITIONAL ISSUSES:
=====================
[] Some concern around narcotics use during admission and 
associated constipation. 
[] Discharged with 14 pills of 5mg oxycodone
[] Would check a chem-10 at PCP ___ appointment, magnesium 
required replacement during admission likely due to multiple BMs
[] Would likely benefit from connection to a pain management 
specialist
[] Uptitrate gabapentin as tolerated, discharged on 300 mg TID 
[] Patient with intermittent use of methotrexate would benefit
from outpatient Rheum follow up (previously in system) 
[] Likely would benefit from GI follow up in ___ clinic 
(___
recommended Dr. ___ or Dr. ___ on a
prior admission)
[] NEW MEDS: Gabapentin 300mg TID, oxybutynin 5mg BID, 
levofloxacin 500mg q24h through ___
