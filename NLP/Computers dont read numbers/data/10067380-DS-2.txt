Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HISTORY: 
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
POD#0, the patient had episodes of afib with RVR overnight, 
which came down with her home Metoprolol.
POD#1, she received 5 mg IV Metoprolol for continued afib with 
RVR.  She was given a 500 mL bolus of fluid for a low BP after 
working with physical therapy.
POD#2, Her WBC was 12.7 and she had a tmax of 100.1. She was 
requiring 1LNC with O2 saturations low to mid 90's. A chest xray 
was obtained and showed no pneumonia/infectious process. Urine 
studies were obtained and the urinalysis was negative.  The 
urine culture was pending at time of discharge.  The rehab will 
be contacted if the urine culture comes back positive and needs 
to be treated.
POD#3, the patient was unable to void.  A foley was replaced and 
a voiding trial will be performed on ___ at the rehab.

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications. The patient received Xarelto 10 mg daily (half 
of her home dose) given her high bleeding risk starting on the 
morning of POD#1. The surgical dressing will remain on until 
POD#7 after surgery. The patient was seen daily by physical 
therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and 
repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was 
tolerating a regular diet and feeling well. The patient was 
afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient's hematocrit was 
acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on an oral 
regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly intact and 
the dressing was intact. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity. 
 
Ms. ___ is discharged to rehab in stable condition.
