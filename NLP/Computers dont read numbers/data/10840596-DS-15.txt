Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service for 
evaluation and treatment.  On ___, the patient underwent 
left axillary to brachial artery bypass grafting with PTFE, 
which went well without complication (reader referred to the 
Operative Note for details). After a brief, uneventful stay in 
the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids and 
perioperative antibiotics, with a ___ catheter, and IV 
dilaudid for pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically 
stable.

Neuro: The patient received IV dilaudid with good effect and 
adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient 
was transitioned to oral pain medications. The patient was noted 
to be somnolent POD1. When aroused she was conversant and 
answered questions appropriately. Narcotics were held with this 
sedation. The patient also had slurred speech but a nonfocal 
neurological exam. Toxicology screen was sent that returned 
positive for cocaine metabolites. The patient had numerous home 
medications and other unknown pills in her possession and these 
were secured outside of her room after a search that was allowed 
with her permission. She also stated she was not reliably taking 
her seroquel or neurontin as prescribed so these were held when 
the patient was somnolent. Her mental status was improved at the 
time of discharge. SHe was encouraged to discuss with her PCP 
about her not taking seroquel/neurontin reliably and whether she 
needed to adjust her dosing accordingly. The addition of a 
narcotic pain medication and the importance of not taking with 
other substances was discussed with the patient. SHe was kept on 
CIWA protocol while inpatient.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. She was mildly 
tachycardic likely owing to mild withdrawal.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well 
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, 
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were 
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. ___ catheter 
was removed POD1 and the patient subsequently voided without 
issue.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection. Patient was discharged 
on 5 days bactrim. 

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required. Known preopeative 
thrombocytopenia was demonstrated on laboratory values but no 
active issues with postoperative bleeding were appreciated 
requiring intervention.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during 
this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as 
possible.

Other: social work was consulted given her past history of 
domestic violence and substance abuse. She felt safe at home and 
did not express any thoughts of harm to self or others. She did 
receive materials about substance abuse therapy.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.
