moderate right pleural effusion and increased moderate 
cardiomegaly. 

R proximal humerus fracture on CXR is old from ___
 
CT Head w/o contrast ___:

be performed.

DISCHARGE LABS:

___ 07:10AM BLOOD Calcium-8.7 Phos-3.1 Mg-2.___ woman with multiple medical problems including severe CHF, AF 
(on coumadin), hypothyrodism, malignant melanoma x 2 who 
presented from assisted living s/p unwitnessed fall -- likely 
due to hypovolemia. Course has been complicated by 
supertherapeutic INR.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# Back pain s/p fall: At admission she presented from assisted 
living s/p unwitnessed fall p/w severe back pain.  CT head, 
pelvis and spine negative for acute fracture after fall. On the 
floor she was medically managed with pain control -- received 
standing tylenol, PRN vicodin and lidocaine patches. It was 
thought that the fall occurred in the setting of hypovolemia; pt 
is on lasix for CHF with metolazone PRN for weight gain but 
received 5 mg of metolazone instead of the 2.5 mg that was 
prescribed. Patient complained of dizziness when standing during 
admission and was unable to stand long enough to complete 
orthostatic vital signs. Her daughter, her health care proxy, 
did not want to pursue aggressive workup for injuries or 
etiology of fall.  Pt was evaluated by physical therapy and 
rehab was recommended following discharge.  She should continue 
standing tylenol and PRN hydrocodone-acetaminophen for 
breakthrough pain.  Metolazone was discontinued to avoid further 
episodes of orthostasis from hypovolemia.

# Atrial Fibrillation - CHADS2 = 2: Rate-controlled with 
atenolol and on coumadin prior to this admission.  Her atenolol 
was continued during this admission.  Her INR was checked with 
daily labs and was found to be supratherpeutic on ___ to 
4.7. Her coumadin was held for 2 days ___ & ___ and will not 
be restarted at discharge (on day of discharge, INR 4.1).  She 
will need to have her INR checked daily for the next few days 
and warfarin should be restarted when INR <3.0 (prior warfarin 
schedule was 2.5 mg daily except 5 mg on ___.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure - severe, on cardiac hospice.  
At admission had crackles on exam but was not overtly fluid 
overloaded. O2 saturations were maintained above 92%.  She was 
continued on home lasix, spironolactone, and beta blocker. 
Metolazone was taken PRN prior to admission for weight gain, but 
given hypovolemia is likely etiology of falls, this was 
discontinued at discharge.  If patient gains weight or is short 
of breath, would consider restarting metolazone following 
discharge.
  
# RLE ulcer: Stable during this admission. Called a wound care 
consult who recommended using 6" ace wrap RLE start below toes 
to below ankle in spiral fashion - on in am, and off pm.

# Hypothyroidism: stable during this admission. Continued home 
dose of levothyroxine.
  
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- will need INR checked daily as she was supratherapeutic with 
INR at 4.1 at the time of discharge and coumadin was held.  
Restart coumadin when INR <3.0
- Metolazone was discontinued on discharge due to hypovolemia, 
should consider restarting if pt experiences weight gain or 
dyspnea.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___, you were admitted to ___ where 
you presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of 
back pain that started after sustaining a fall.  Your fall was 
likely to secondary to receiving an extra dose of your diuretics 
because you were gaining weight.  You became dizzy and 
lightheaded after losing too much fluid, which provoked the 
fall.  You had multiple imaging tests of your head, back, hips 
and chest all of which were negative for any fractures.  You 
were treated with Tylenol and Vicodin for your back pain.  We 
also placed a lidocaine patch on your back to help with the 
pain. 

In addition, your INR (the number measured to follow your 
coumadin) was higher than the therapeutic goal making you at 
increased risk of bleeding.  Because you are at risk of falls 
your coumadin was held.  You should be restarted at a lower 
dose.  Please continue holding your coumadin until you have your 
INR checked on ___ and have your dose adjusted.

Please take all of your medications as prescribed.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
