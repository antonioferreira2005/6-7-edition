signed a CV once on the unit. She remained in good behavioral 
control throughout this hospitalization and did not require

PSYCHIATRIC
#)On admission, the patient reported more "spacing out" that she 
attributed to seizures as well as confusion and auditory 
hallucinations to harm herself.

and seroquel due to concerns that this was causing an 
encephalopathy. With these medication changes Ms. ___ felt much 
better.
