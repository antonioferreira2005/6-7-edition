Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with a h/o DMII, HTN, and OA 
who was transferred from ___ for 
management of MSSA bacteremia, osteomyelitis, and epidural 
abscess.

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
# MSSA bacteremia, osteomyelitis, and epidural abscess: The 
patient was transferred from ___ on ___ 
for spine eval of epidural abscess. Patient was being managed 
with linezolid on transfer. Seen by the spine team here who 
recommended conservative management of the epidural abscess. 
Seen by ID who recommended nafcillin due to need for prolonged 
course and adverse effects of linezolid.  Due to penicillin 
allergy, pt underwent desensitization in the MICU until 
nafcillin levels therapeutic. In ICU pt was noted to have 
multiple neurotic excoriations on scalp, possible source of 
MSSA. Pt underwent nafcillin desensitization protocol. She 
tolerated desensitization well, and was continued on nafcillin 
2g IV Q4. She was transitioned back to medicine floor for 
further management. Patient received PICC by ID. Pt did not have 
any symptoms of cord compression throughout hospitalization. Had 
few loose stolls prior to d/c but C. Diff negative. She will 
need repeat MRI in follow-up.  

# ___: Pt has chronic renal insufficency, baseline Cr 1.4. She 
had a bump in Cr from 1.5 to 1.7 the day after starting 
nafcillin. Given concern for AIN, renal was consulted. Cr 
remained between 1.6 and 1.8 over the next two days. Pt did not 
have any rash or peripheral eosinophilia. UA did not show 
elevated WBC. Few WBC casts, but renal team recommended we 
continue nafcillin given that this is unlikely to be AIN (AIN 
typically starts about 48 hrs after starting offending agent, 
usually see rash or peripheral eosinophilia, etc.). Patient will 
need repeat creatinine measured this coming ___.

# Fall: Unclear why pt has fall, but most likely mechanical 
given pt's history of OA. Syncopal workup at OSH showed no acute 
abnormality on CT head, EKG was within normal limits, and 
troponins were negative x 3. Fall may be related to infectious 
etiology, given patient's known bacteremia and epidural abscess. 
The patient underwent OT consult for cognitive evaluation as 
well as rehab evaluation.  

#. Anxiety - Patient with severe anxiety disorder. Required 
intermittent ativan while in house. Anxiety improves with 
re-assurance. 

# Thrombocytosis from OSH: Likely reactive. Plt downtrended, 546 
on discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 

# DM: Patient was kept on ISS in hospital.   
  
# Depression: Home paroxetine was initially held as risk of 
serotonin syndrome on linezolid, but this was resumed after 
patient started nafcillin. 

# HLD: Home ezetimibe was held.   

# HTN: Patient was kept on home lisinopril. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 

# Cousin ___ - ___, or ___ 

# Follow-up MRI as outpatient to evaluate for resolution of 
osteomyelitis and epidural abscess. This will be scheduled by 
ID. 

# Will need chem-7 drawn this ___ hours after 
discharge. If Cr is 1.7-1.9 then check again in 48 hours. If 
greater than 2.0, please call ___ clinic to determine whether 
will need change to antibiotic regimen. 

# blood cultures are pending at time of discharge
