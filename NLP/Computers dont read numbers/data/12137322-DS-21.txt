Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY:
==============
___ is a ___ year old ___ woman with 
known ___ ESRD ___ lupus nephritis, autoimmune hepatitis 
(Followed by Dr. ___, HTN, osteoporosis, colon cancer s/p 
colectomy ___ years ago with ostomy, who presented as a 
direct admission for initiation
of dialysis.  Of note, patient was initially on home hospice 
but
had a change of heart and wished for trial of hemodialysis to
improve her symptoms.  She had a tunneled HD line placed at ___ 
___
___ and then presented for first session of HD that she
tolerated well. No fluid was taken off during this process. 
Patient had trial runs of HD ___, then a full run on ___ 
(___). She tolerated HD without any difficulty. Had elevated 
blood pressure throughout course relieved by HD runs. 
Antihypertensive medications were started and uptitrated during 
hospitalization for improved control. Also described subacute 
abdominal pain w/ n/v without change in her ostomy output. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==================
[] GI follow-up for ostomy management, evaluation of possible 
polyp on stoma
[] Could benefit from nutrition consult for concern for 
malnutrition
[] Amlodipine added to home blood pressure regimen. She would 
benefit from further titration as outpatient

ACUTE ISSUES:
============
#ESRD now on HD
#MCTD, SLE
#PRGN ___ lupus nephritis
#Metabolic disarray
#HTN
Patient was initially on home hospice and against initiation of 
HD, then had a changed mind and had tunneled ___ placed at 
AV care on ___ had trial runs of HD, which 
were tolerated well, then on ___ had full run which was 
also well tolerated. She remained inpt for monitoring through 
___ with planned initiation of HD as an outpt on ___. A PPD 
was read during her stay as was a CXR for assessment of TB, 
both were negative. She was given calcium acetate daily. Home 
immunosuppression was continued with hydroxychloroquine, 
prednisone, mycophenelate mofetil. She was also continued on 
home labetalol 600mg BID and torsemide 40mg for hypertension 
however she had intermittent hypertension with systolic blood 
pressure as high as 200s for which amlodipine was added on ___. 

#Abdominal pain
#Nausea/vomiting
#Colon cancer s/p colectomy
Patient described some irritation at ostomy site, predominantly 
itching and concern that there was a "tumor" in her ostomy. She 
had several areas of irritation and erythema with some tissue 
friability at her stoma site likely related to her stoma coming 
in and out however cannot rule out small polyp. She was 
reassured and can continue to discuss with her PCP regarding 
need for further GI evaluation. 

#Chronic low back pain: has been ongoing for months without red 
flag symptoms (no fevers, weakness, numbness). Given Tylenol 
for pain. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#HFpEF
Euvolemic on examination, continued home torsemide and started 
HD

#Chronic normocytic anemia
___ CKD, EPO with HD as managed by nephrology

#GERD
Continued home PPI

#Autoimmune hepatitis
Followed outpatient by hepatology, monitored

[x]Patient seen and examined on day of discharge. >30 minutes 
spent on discharge planning and care coordination on day of 
discharge.
