CXR: COMPARISON: Comparison is made to chest x-ray performed 
___. 
  
There is stable flattening of the bilateral hemidiaphragms with 
a relative 
paucity of vasculature in the left upper lung, consistent with 
reported 
history of COPD. Stable mild bilateral blunting of the 
costophrenic angles 
may represent a small pleural effusion. No focal opacification 
concerning for pneumonia identified. Mediastinal, hilar, and 
cardiac contours are 
unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: Overall unchanged exam. Stable minimal blunting of 
bilateral 
costophrenic angles may represent small effusions versus 
scarring. 
.  
EKG: ___: Sinus rhythm. Consider left atrial abnormality. 
Somewhat late R wave progression. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since 
the previous tracing the rate is slower. QRS voltage is less 
prominent in the precordial leads.  
.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: ___ yo F h/o COPD on 3L with recent COPD 
exacerbation, HTN on ___ presenting with uvula swelling and 
urticaria which was concerning for allergic reaction to 
levofloxacin or Losartan.  
.  
# Uvula Swelling: Only new exposures include levofloxacin and 
prednisone. Levofloxacin renally cleared and patient does have 
mildly decreased GFR, so the timing of this new medication may 
coincide with her reaction. Another possibility includes the 
patient's ___. Both medications can cause an allergic reaction 
in less than 1 % of all noted reactions. Airway did not appear 
compromised. Patient had no dysphagia, odynophagia, dyspnea, 
stridor and is managing secretions without difficulty. On home 
O2. Was initially using accessory muscles, however improved 
after nebulizers. We emailed Dr. ___ and the 
recommendation was to continue to hold levofloxacin and 
losartan, while was okay to start on HCTZ. ENT was also 
consulted and recommended tx with steroids. She was given an 
dose of epinephrine in the ED and then started on methaPred than 
transitioned to prednisone 40mg with recs to take it for 5 days. 
Her uvula slight less swollen at time of discharge. As noted 
above, it was only mildly swollen by the time she arrived to the 
MICU. she was instructed to stop taking levofloxacin and 
possible losartan. I gave granddaughter verbal instructions over 
the phone since they could not come to pick up the patients.

moderate distress on presentation which improved with neb 
treatments. She appears to have increase WOB due to her movement 
disorder and as per the family she was on her baseline. She

at baseline. He will discuss this with patient during her 
upcoming visit.

E/E', so does not appear to have diastolic dysfunction. Given 
mild respiratory distress on presentation and pleural effusion, 
she was given only one dose of lasix 10mg IV with good response. 
She was breathing comfortable during the rest of her stay, so 
further doses of lasix were given.  
.

steroids. She was continued on her home dose of lantus. I

her FSG be checked at home 4 times per day (before meals and at 
bed time). I also recommended that she continues with her 
sliding scale and call her PCP if her glucose remains elevated 
>300. Metformin was held while she was inpatient and restarted 
once she was d/ced.
