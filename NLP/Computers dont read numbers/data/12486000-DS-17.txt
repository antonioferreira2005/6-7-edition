ECHO ___
This study was compared to the prior study of ___.  
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild ___. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). No resting LVOT 
gradient. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. 

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal 
ascending aorta diameter. No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal 
arch coarctation. 

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. 
Mild (1+) AR. 

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. 
Moderate/severe MVP. Late systolic MR ___. Moderate to severe 
(3+) MR. 

___ VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR. 
Normal PA systolic pressure. 

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized. 
No PS. Physiologic PR. 

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.  
Conclusions  
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is moderate/severe posterior leaflet mitral 
valve prolapse. A late systolic jet of Moderate to severe (3+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe prolapse of the posterior leaflet 
of the mitral valve with moderate to severe mid-systolic mitral 
regurgitation. Mild elevation of pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
estimated pulmonary pressures are slightly lower. The other 
findings are similar.   

CXR ___
  
FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear with no evidence of 
consolidation, effusion, or 
pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is at the upper 
limits of normal.  
No acute fractures are identified. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxemia: Most likely progression of PE. Infectious workup 
negative for PCP (sputum smear), clear CXR, sputum grew 
contaminate without clear organism, urine negative. PE 
workup/treatment as below. Patient was monitored on tele with 
cont O2 monitoring.

# Chronic PE: Presented with hypoxia and dyspnea on exertion and 
weakness. History of unprovoked ___ ___, readmitted ___, 
Atrius heme consult at that time reduced Lovenox to 100mg daily 
for improved compliance, patient reports compliance on that 
regimen, but complicated by memory loss that he states is from 
his Effexor (see psych below). EKG without R heart strain, BNP 
normal, hemodynamically stable except with sinus tachycardia. 
Trops negative x2, echo w/o R heart strain or pul HTN. Patient 
continued to require supplemental O2 with exertion and was 
discharged with home O2, although on the day of discharge he was 
noted to ambulate three flights of stairs without dropping sats 
below 90. 

# Lactic acidosis: Resolved with IVFs, likely be ___ etoh and 
volume depletion. 

# EtOH dependence with intoxication/withdrawal: h/o EtOH with 
withdrawal, no history of seizures. Last drink ___, 
Received 40mg Valium on the floor, scoring 0 on CIWA at 
discharge.
Continued on B12, thiamine, MVI, folic acid. He had a social 
work consult and was given info for outpatient rehab. Naltrexone 
was increased to 100mg qHS.

# HIV: Patient had pancytopenia ___ house approximating prior 
counts. Continued on HAART and atovaquone. He has not been 
compliant with atovaquone due to taste, and he was encouraged to 
adhere. PCP workup negative for sputum smear.  

# Psych/Depression: Multiple hospitalizations, most recently 
___ for SI, not currently reporting SI. He reports memory 
loss as contributing to medication non adherence. He was changed 
to duloxetine, continued on Seroquel.

# Mesenteric Mass: Approx 4.5 x 3.5 x 6.3cm mass at jejunal 
mesentery, first noted ___, per radiology Ddx includes 
carcinoid tumor, chronic sclerosing mesenteritis, amyloidosis, 
calcified metastatic implants, and peritoneal echinococcus. 
Patient is planned for octreotide scan but has not shown for 
appointments.  He is aware that this needs to be followed up.
