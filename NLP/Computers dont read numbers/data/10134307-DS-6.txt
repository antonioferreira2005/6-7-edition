STUDIES: 
___ CXR (AP): (my read) ?LLL opacification. 
.
___ ECG 11:02:  sinus tachycardia, 109 bpm, NA, RBBB 
morphology, borderline LVH using V1, V5-6, no STE, TWI in V1-2, 
III, avF. 
. 
___ CXR PA/Lat/Decub: PA, lateral, and decubitus views were 
reviewed. 
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Moderate layering pleural 
effusion is on the left. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity is 
best seen in the 
decubitus view. This suggests the presence of a consolidation in 
the left 
lower lobe medially. There is no pneumothorax. 
.
___ CXR PA/Lat: Small-to-moderately large left pleural 
effusion with left perihilar consolidation. 
.
___ Ultrasound guided thoracentesis: Successful 
ultrasound-guided left pleural thoracentesis with removal of 280 
mL of cloudy, straw-colored fluid. Fluid was sent for laboratory 
analysis per ordering clinical team. 
Upright radiograph should be obtained in approximately ___ hours 
with a repeat radiograph in an additional 2 hours to evaluate 
for any ___ pneumothorax. These findings were 
communicated to the ordering physician, ___ on date 
of exam at 10:45 a.m. 
.
___ CXR (2 hours after procedure): Followup of the patient 
after ultrasound-guided thoracocentesis for the presence of 
pneumothorax.  
PA and lateral upright chest radiograph were reviewed in 
comparison to 
___. There is slight interval decrease in the 
amount of left pleural effusion which is still present, 
small-to-moderate and also seen along the major fissure. There 
is no evidence of pneumothorax as seen on the current study. The 
left basal consolidation is unchanged. The right lung is clear. 
There is no evidence of right pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o asthma, history of spontaneous PTX, admitted with 6 
days of subjective fever, productive cough, left side chest 
discomfort, and CXR with ?LLL pneumonia.  

# Pneumonia, likely caused by aspiration. Further history 
revealed that his pain and symptoms started the day after 
episodes of dry heaves and vomiting. The diagnosis of aspiration 
pneumonia is supported by leukocytosis, fever, productive cough, 
and LLL opacification on film. DFA to evaluate for flu was 
performed x 2; the first showed insufficient columnar cells, and 
the second showed too many polymononuclear cells; viral culture 
was negative at the time of discharge, so Tamiflu and droplet 
precautions were discontinued. CXR revealed no pneumothorax, but 
a parapneumonic effusion in the left lower lobe (see below). He 
was started on levofloxacin on ___, and clindamycin was added 
on ___. He will continue both antibiotics until ___. At the 
time of discharge, his white blood cell count had trended down 
and he felt clinically much improved. He never required oxygen 
during this hospitalization.

# Parapneumonic effusion. PA/Lat/Decub film on ___ 
demonstrated a layering free-flowing pleural effusion. However, 
the patient had persistent fevers during his hospital course, so 
sampling of the effusion was indicated. The gram stain of his 
pleural fluid was negative (although was exudative, consistent 
with a parapneumonic effusion). He will require serial chest 
x-rays to ensure resolution of the effusion. If his effusion 
persists at his next follow up appointment, he may need 
readmission for further procedures to address the pleural 
effusion.  

# Eosinophilia. Had persistent eosinophilia noted on CBC/diff. 
Unclear what baseline is. Not thought to be contributing to 
current clinical picture (and present on admission prior to the 
administration of antibiotics). ___ be related to atopy given 
history of asthma. He will require further outpatient evaluation 
of the eosinophilia. 

# Asthma. No sigificant wheezing on exam.  He was continued on 
home regimen of albuterol inhaler PRN and discharged with a 
prescription. 

# Acute renal failure. Mild rise in creatinine to 1.3 on 
admission, likely ___ poor po intake. Resolved with 1L IV fluid. 


# Liver lesion. Noted on informal ultrasound ___. Needs 
outpatient formal liver ultrasound to better characterize. 
Deferred to outpatient providers.

Given the upcoming holiday weekend, he was discharged home on 
___ oral antibiotics. At the time of discharge, he was 
afebrile (but had had a temperature of 101.6F within 24 hours), 
ambulatory, and satting well. He was specifically instructed to 
return to the ED if he felt worse, had worsened pain, shortness 
of breath, or worsening fevers. He has an appointment in the 
___ clinic on ___ for repeat CXR, repeat CBC (to 
evaluate white blood cell count), and general assessment of his 
clinical status.
