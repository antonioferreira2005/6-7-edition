Date of Birth:  ___             Sex:   F
 
Service: NEUROLOGY
 
Allergies: 
Penicillins
 
Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Expressive aphasia, left hemiplegia
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TPA bolus documented as being given at 20:18 on ___, 
infusion started at 20:25
 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old, left handed woman with
history of prior TIA (___), HTN, HLD, DM non insulin 
dependent
and mild dementia who presents with acute onset of expressive
aphasia and left sided hemiplegia. History provided by daughter
and granddaughter as patient is unable to provide history. 

The patient was in her usual state of health until 6:30 ___ on
___.  She had just finished dinner with her family, who 
were
together for the holiday.  She then acutely was noted to slump 
in
her chair and become nonverbal.  Her granddaughter assessed her
and noted that she had a left facial droop, and was not moving
the left side.  When asked questions, she was following some
commands on the right side (squeezing hand to command, moving
right leg to command) but could not move the left side to
command.  She was nonverbal.  They pressed her Lifeline and
brought her to ___ for further evaluation.

At ___, vitals were notable for BP 156/91, HR 50 (sinus
bradycardia), RR 15, T 97.7. On arrival, patient was somnolent,
and opened eyes to voice. ED physician notes that patient had
left gaze deviation; no other concern for seizure was noted.
NIHSS per their exam was 24 (level of consciousness 3, LOC
questions 2, LOC commands 2, partial left sided gaze palsy, left
arm for right arm 1, left leg 3, right leg 4, limb ataxia 1,
sensory to, language 3, dysarthria 2). She underwent STAT NCHCT
which revealed decrease in gray-white matter differentiation in
right temporal-parietal area as well as internal capsule 
(ASPECTs
score 7 per my read). CTA H/N revealed occlusion of the R ICA
just distal to the bifurcation, as well as occlusion of proximal
R MCA with minimal to no collateralization. She also had CTA
chest to rule out aortic dissection which was reportedly
negative. Decision made to undergo tPA, given within time window
and no contraindications. tPA bolus documented as being given at
20:18 on ___, infusion started at 20:25. She was 
transferred
to ___ for further care and consideration of thrombectomy. 

Currently, history unable to be obtained from patient due to
mental status. 

Of note:
-Family reports that patient has a history of a TIA in ___.  At that time, she presented with acute onset of
dysarthria, mild expressive aphasia, and tongue numbness that
lasted for several hours.  She was hospitalized at an outside
hospital for about 48 hours, diagnosed with a TIA, and 
discharged
with aspirin.

-At baseline, patient has a history of mild dementia.  She
requires assistance with much of her ADLs, including assistance
bathing, doing household tasks, preparing meals, and managing
finances.  She is independent with walking and does not require
an assistive device.  She is independent with toileting.  She 
has
extensive family support; she lives with her daughter and her
granddaughter serves as her PCA.

 
Past Medical History:

aphasia and tongue numbness), on aspirin 
-HTN
-HLD
-T2 DM, non insulin dependent 
-Mild dementia, requires assistance with ADLs

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an ___ year left handed female whom presented with 
aphasia and left sided weakness whom was found to have right 
middle cerebral artery stroke likely secondary to new diagnosis 
atrial fibrillation. Patient received TPA, but was not candidate 
for thrombectomy.  Patient was started on apixiban for 
anticoagulation. Patient had feeding tube placed as our swallow 
team determined that she could not safely tolerate oral feeds 
without risk of aspiration. Patient's examination on discharge 
is most significant for aphasia with no verbal output, inability 
to follow commands, and dense left sided weakness. Patient does 
move right upper and lower extremity spontaneously. Patient is 
DNR/DNI, but family would like to continue full medical 
management. 

Patient's blood pressure management has been changed and we are 
discharging her on lisinopril 30 mg daily and have discontinued 
losartan, metoprolol, and triamterene-HCTZ.

Patient had an infected hematoma at PEG placement site and will 
complete a course of antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and 
metronidazole) on ___. 

Patient with oral thrush and is completing a fourteen day course 
of low dose of fluconazole on ___. 

Patient has been scheduled for stroke clinic follow up with Dr. 
___.

Discharge Instructions:
You presented to the hospital with difficulty speaking and left 
sided weakness and were found to have a large stroke on the 
right side of your brain.  We believe that the stroke occurred 
because of an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.  
As we have explained, this abnormal heart rhythm can lead to the 
development of blood clots in the heart that can then travel and 
cause strokes in the brain.  We have started you on a new 
medication called apixiban to prevent blood clots from forming 
and to help to prevent this from happening again.  In addition, 
we determined during this admission that it was unsafe for you 
to eat safely and therefore we have placed a feeding tube in 
your abdomen.  We have discharged you to acute rehabilitation so 
that they can work with you to maximize your potential for 
recovery. 

We have changed up your high blood pressure management and you 
will now take Lisinopril 30 mg daily.  Please do not resume 
taking your losartan, Metoprolol, and Triamterene-HCTZ. 

In addition, we found that you had an infection at the site 
where the feeding tube was placed and you will be completing an 
antibiotic course.  

Thank you for allowing us to care for you, 
___ Neurology
