PLEURA: No pleural effusion. 
LUNG: 
  
1. PARENCHYMA:  Mild biapical pleuroparenchymal scarring.  No 
suspicious 
pulmonary nodules or masses.  A couple of millimetric 
intrapulmonary lymph 
nodes are noted in the right middle lobe (series 302, image 154) 
and right 
lower lobe (series 302, image 167).  No airspace consolidation.  
Ground-glass 
opacification in the lung bases bilaterally most likely 
represent 
microatelectasis in the absence of associated bronchiectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following cardiac cath on ___ he was admitted for surgical 
work-up. on ___ he was taken to the operating room where he 
underwent an aortic valve replacement with 27mm ___ 
mechanical valve with Dr. ___. Please see operative note for 
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the 
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later this 
day he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and 
extubated.
 Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed 
toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to 
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and 
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  Coumadin 
initiated for mechanical valve with INR goal ___.  The patient 
was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service for assistance 
with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 4

pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was 
discharged home in good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions.  Anti-coagulation management arranged with ___
