History of Present Illness:
___ male with past medical history significant for
hypertension, morbid obesity, OSA, sarcoidosis, history of
testicular cancer, and GERD who initially presented to ___ 30 minutes after he started experiencing
left-sided chest pain, jaw pain, and left arm pain.  Patient
reports that he was sitting in a chair drinking soda at onset of
symptoms.  Initial pain was then associated with diaphoresis 
that
made him worry enough to head to the ED. in the ___ ED, patient
was noted to have ST elevations in the inferior leads.  He was
given a full dose aspirin, a loading dose of ticagrelor, and
nitroglycerin as needed and transferred to the Cath Lab for
immediate PCI.  Left heart catheterization was notable for
complete occlusion of the RCA.  The procedure was complicated by
an inability to keep RCA patent with angioplasty.  The RCA clot
was also unable to be aspirated via thrombectomy.  No stenting
was performed and IABP was placed due to continued angina. 
 
On arrival to the CCU, patient endorses above history.  Reports
that his pain is currently a 1 out of 10.  States that pain
during cath decreased from a 10 to a 2.5.  Patient does report

complaints currently.  Patient also notes that he missed taking
his antihypertensive medications for ___ days prior to his MI.

IMAGING/STUDIES

CXR ___
No previous images.  There is enlargement of the cardiac 
silhouette without vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or 
acute focal pneumonia.  The tip of the IABP lies approximately 2 
cm below the top of the transverse arch of the aorta. 

TTE ___
Poor image quality. Echo contrast was used to opacify LV. The 
left atrium is moderately dilated. The
right atrium is mildly enlarged. The LVEF is at least moderately 
reduced secondary to hypokinesis of the
inferior septum, akinesis of the inferior free wall, and 
dyskinesis of the posterior wall. The visually
estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 35%. The right 
ventrlcle is not well seen. The aortic sinus
diameter is normal for gender with mildly dilated ascending 
aorta. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral leaflets appear structurally normal with no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is trivial mitral
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve is not well seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with past medical history of 
hypertension, testicular cancer, GERD, sarcoidosis, psoriasis, 
morbid obesity, and OSA who initially presented to ___ 
___, found to have RCA STEMI with unsuccessful PCI 
status post IABP placement, transferred to ___ for further 
management, now s/p IABP pull and transfer to the floor. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Inferior STEMI - Patient initially presented with left sided 
chest pain to ___, found to have inferior 
lead STE with elevated troponins that peaked at 2.32, received 
full dosing aspirin and ticagrelor load. Also underwent cardiac 
catheterization found to have RCA complete occlusion. Procedure 
was complicated by unsuccessful angioplasty, also clot unable to 
be aspirated by thrombectomy. Stenting was subsequently deferred 
and IABP was placed due to continued angina. Patient was 
subsequently transferred to the CCU. He remained hemodynamically 
stable and IABP was subsequently removed. He was medically 
managed, integrillin drip was discontinued after 18 hours, 
heparin drip was discontinued after 48 hours. He was continued 
on aspirin 81mg daily, ticagrelor 90mg BID, atorvastatin 80mg. 
He was started on metoprolol 6.25mg PO Q6H and captopril 12.5mg 
TID. After transfer to the cardiology floor, he was transitioned 
from ticagrelor to clopidogrel due to cost considerations as the 
patient's insurance did not cover ticagrelor. He was also 
transitioned to a stable Lisinopril dose of 5mg after he 
tolerated the captopril. 

#Hypertension - Patient was started on metoprolol 6.25mg PO Q6H 
and captopril 12.5mg TID and transitioned to Lisinopril 5mg. We 
his home amlodipine, losartan, and hydrochlorothiazide in the 
setting of starting an ACEi. We did not restart his home 
amlodipine or HCTZ ___ since his blood pressure on the 
Lisinopril were very controlled with BP max in the 110s. 

# Leukocytosis - Found to have leukocytosis, without obvious 
infectious source, remained afebrile. Leukocytosis was thought 
to be reactive in the setting of STEMI per above, empiric 
antibiotics were deferred. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
===============
#H/o Testicular Cancer - s/p orchiectomy, followed outpatient by 
oncology. Currently in remission.

#GERD - Continued home omeprazole 

#Sarcoidosis - Not on active treatment. 

#OSA - Continued CPAP at night

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================

[ ] Stopped amlodipine, HCTZ, and losartan. Blood pressures in 
100s once started on Lisinopril 5mg. Will need follow up BP eval 
and may need to restart on prior amlodipine vs. HCTZ if BPs 
elevated
[ ] Will need outpatient repeat TTE to evaluate for ___ HFrEF of 
35% to see if regains an function in 40 days
[ ] Please obtain repeat chem10 in ___ days with you primary 
care physician

___:
==========================
Aspirin 81mg once daily
Plavix 75mg daily (chosen as ticagrelor cost prohibitive)
Metoprolol 25mg once daily
Atorvastatin 80mg once daily 

Changed Medication Doses:
==========================
None

Medications Stopped/Held:
==========================
- amlodipine 10mg stopped now that BPs controlled on ACEi 
- HCTZ held as above
- Losartan stopped since started on ACEi (Lisinopril 5mg)
