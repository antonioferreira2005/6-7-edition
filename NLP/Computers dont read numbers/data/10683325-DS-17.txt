      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S). 

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary): 
      Further incubation required to determine the presence or 
absence of
      commensal respiratory flora. 
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    SPARSE GROWTH. 

___ CT ABD/PELVIS 
1. Increased, large amount of simple ascites. Extensive 
anasarca.  
2. Shrunken nodular liver suggesting cirrhosis. Liver appears 
somewhat 
decreased in size since ___ which may be due to worsening 
cirrhosis but also due to some compression from the large amount 
of adjacent ascites. 
3. Thickened ascending colon wall which may be secondary to 
ascites/third 
spacing, although an underlying colitis (ischemic, infectious, 
inflammatory) 
cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation and close follow-up 
advised. 
4. Status post cholecystectomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Uroseptic shock - Treated empirically with cipro/flagyl 
followed by vanc/cipro/aztreonam (given PCN allergy) upon 
arrival to the ICU. Urine culture grew ESBL Klebsiella 
pneumoniae and cipro/aztreonam were exchanged for amikacin and 
tigecycline. Single-agrent vasopressor therapy was required. 
.
#Hypoxemic respiratory failure - Attributed to ARDS vs. TRALI 
vs. volume overload in the setting of multiple transfusions. 
Intubated ___ in concordance with the patient's wishes. 
.  
#Coagulopathy - Attributed to DIC superimposed on baseline 
cirrhotic coagulopathy. Supported with pRBC, FFP, and cryo.
.  
#Acute renal failure - Initially improved with albumin and blood 
products. Renal function subsequently declined in the setting of 
diuresis.  
.  
#HCV Cirrhosis - Continued lactulose and rifaximin. 
.  
#HIV - Continued ARV.
.
#End of life care - On the ___ hospital day ___ ventilator 
day), as the patient had not improved significantly and had a 
poor prognosis, the patient's two sisters (one of whom is 
healthcare proxy) and brother chose to pursue comfort measures 
only. Fentanyl and versed infusions were stopped and the patient 
was terminally extubated once she displayed some spontaneous 
respiratory effort. She passed away at 8:05 ___. Her family was 
notified, and they declined autopsy. Covering overnight 
intensivist notified.
