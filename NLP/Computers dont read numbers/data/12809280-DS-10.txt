History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old M diagnosed with AML with 
unfavorable prognosis. Underwent MUD allogenic stem cell 
transplant on ___. Unfortunately on 
day +100 had cytogenetic relapse. There was no improvement in 
his counts after withdrawal of immunosuppression, bone marrow 
biopsy revealed morphologic relapse on ___. His course was 
c/b graft failure/necrotic marrow and now relapse. Allo 
admission ___ notable for HIT, stomatitis, CMV/EBV viremia, RUE 
basilic vein thrombosis ___ PICC (not anticoagulated due to low 
plts), tacrolimus-induced HTN, febrile neutropenia, IJ site 
cellulitis.  Bone marrow aspirate ___ neg for blasts on 
aspirate but bone marrow ___ w/ 4% blasts. Bone marrow 
chimerism down to 90%. New peripheral blasts detected as of 
___, c/w recurrence. 

Recent events notable for: tacrolimus has been weaned off w/o 
e/o GVHD. Has been CMV/EBV viremic in the past, s/p 
valgancyclovir and Rituxan, both since resolved. 

He received one cycle of decitabine and is now C1D24. Yesterday 
he presented to clinic for planned DLI. His temperature was 
101.3 in the clinic, he denied any symptoms and said he felt

Department for further medical evaluation and treatment.

Mr. ___ remains transfusion dependent, requires PLT three 
times per week, PRBC once a week, and he is profoundly 
neutropenic.

Of note, the pt has outpt providers from multiple institutions. 
His psychiatrist is Dr. ___ at ___, ___. He is 
unsure of the name of his ___ clinic. Per his PCP's

called and messages left.
 
Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
He was diagnosed in ___ with acute leukemia. At diagnosis, 
he was transferred from an outside facility to ___ 
___ with severe pancytopenia, night sweats and bone
pain.  He had extensive workup including diagnostic imaging,
multiple bone marrow biopsies and ultimately a splenectomy.  He
was found to have extensive bone marrow necrosis, reactive
histiocytic infiltration with scattered blasts.  However, upon
cytogenetic testing, he was found to have a complex karyotype.
This being most consistent with acute myeloid leukemia with
unfavorable prognosis.  He received standard induction
chemotherapy of 7 & 3 on ___.  Repeat bone marrow 
biopsies
did not show any evidence of leukemia by FISH as well as
karyotype was now normal. He was discharged from the hospital on
___.
At that point discussion with the patient and family members and
among the ___ team it was decided to proceed with a 
myeloablative
matched unrelated donor allogeneic stem cell transplant as this
would give him best possible treatment option for prolonged
remission given his poor prognostic features at diagnosis - 
occurred ___.
Bone marrow aspirate ___ neg for blasts on aspirate but bone 
marrow ___ w/ 4% blasts. Bone marrow chimerism down to 90% 
(from 99%). New peripheral blasts detected as of ___, c/w 
recurrence.

PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:  
AML with poor prognostic factors as above
Depression/anxiety 
PTSD 
Back pain  
Polysubstance abuse with Methadone maintenance
CMV/EBV viremia
HIT
H/o RUE basilic vein thrombosis in the setting of ___

Brief Hospital Course:
___ M with AML with complex cytogenetics, MUD allotransplant with 
FLU/BU4 conditioning D0 ___, cytogenetic relapse on ___ 
with confirmation on ___ ___ admitted with febrile 
neutropenia, ultimately persistent VRE bacteremia. 
Mr. ___ AML progressed during his protracted hospital 
stay with steady deterioration in his state of health throughout 
in spite of aggressive treatment. As his blast count reached 
20%, his mental and metabolic status deteriorated together with 
his pain. In setting of agitated delirium patient underwent fall 
with head strike resulting in subdural hematoma. Goals of care 
evolved towards comfort measures only in the following days. 
Patient passed comfortably next to his family. 

# Neutropenic fever without localizing symptoms - He returned to 
___ on ___ when he was notified that ___ in pairs. Speciation 
and sensitivity revealed VRE, ultimately patient received 
daptomycin and ampicillin. Continued to spike and having 
positive blood cultures since the first positive culture in 
spite of appropriate dosed therapy based on microbial 
sensitivities. TEE no longer part of plan given aggressive 
terminal stage illness.  

#Subdural hematoma: Secondary to fall in setting of delirium and 
thrombocytopenia. Received seizure prophylaxis palliatively.

#Persistent hypoglycemia: Likely due to poor po intake and liver 
metabolic failure. Refractory to D10W gtt at 200mL/h. This also 
worsens his hyponatremia and volume status. Getting D50 amps 
intermittently.

#Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to intravascular 
depletion in the setting of overall fluid overload. Reflecting 
acutely decompensated inflammatory state due perhaps to 
infection and malignancy. 

# Relapsed AML with complex cytogenetics, s/p induction
with 7+3, post allogeneic transplant MUD (___), Flu/Bu
conditioning, currently has persistent malignant clone and
circulating blasts. He is clinical trial ___. As per the 
protocol he continues to be on study, only second transplant 
will require for him to come off. Severe pancytopenia with ANC 
100, PLT 6 , HCT 23.0 PLT transfusion ___. He has no evidence 
of GVHD off immunosuppression since ___. On ___ concern 
for rising peripheral blast count to 14% out of leukocyte count 
of 500. Blast count continued to rise, reaching 20% on ___.  
Disease considered refractory and terminal, patient ultimately 
made comfort measures only. 

# Pain syndrome/ bone marrow infarction - Chronic, continue home 
medications. Diffuse but mentions legs and left arm more than 
other body parts. Patient's pain continued worsening during the 
admission in spite of high dose narcotics including methadone, 
fentanyl patch and oxycodone. Pain likely in close correlation 
with progression of primary disease. Ultimately patient could 
not tolerate POs and his mental status was not appropriate for 
PCA. Placed on hydromorphone drip at narcotic equivalent dose. 
Patient was comfortable when he passed. 

# Depression/Anxiety - Chronic. Was continued on  quetiapine, 
lithium and bupropion 

# PUD - Severe epigastric pain clinically suggestive of PUD, was 
kept on  H2 blocker and PPI.
