Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, nausea
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP ___
Large duodenal diverticulum 
The bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome. 
Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the 
ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. 
The CBD was 15mm in diameter. Two large filling defects 
consistent with stones were identified in the CBD and CHD. 
The left and right hepatic ducts and all intrahepatic branches 
were normal. 
A limited (due to elevated INR) biliary sphincterotomy was made 
with a sphincterotome. 
A sphincteroplasty was then performed with a 12-15mm CRE balloon 
up to 15mm to facilitate stone extraction. 
The biliary tree was swept with a 12-15mm balloon starting at 
the bifurcation. Two stones were removed. 
The CBD and CHD were swept repeatedly until no further stones 
were seen. 
The final occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of filling 
defects in the CBD. 
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically and 
fluoroscopically. 
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
 
Recommendations: NPO overnight with aggressive IV hydration with 
LR at 200 cc/hr
