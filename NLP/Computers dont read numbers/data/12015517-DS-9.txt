Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ was admitted to the ___ service of the 
___ on ___ for planned ileostomy closure.  The patient 
was taken to the operating room on ___ and underwent the 
closure procedure which was successful and without 
complications. She was then taken to the post-anesthesia 
recovery unit (PACU) and monitored there for several hour 
post-operatively prior to transfer to the medical/surgical floor 
for further recover.  The patient's pos-surgical course was 
typical: she was provided with an appropriate diet which was 
advanced as tolerated, given IV and oral pain control according 
to her oral intake and tolerance and was monitored for any 
post-operative complications such as bleeding, infection, ileus 
and hemodynamic changes. Her wound was cared for daily by the 
nursing staff and evaluated by the resident team and attending 
surgeon.  The patient was then normalized to oral home and pain 
medications, regular diet, and was allowed to ambulate early and 
often.  She tolerated this transition and was then discharged 
home with pain medication and other needed prescriptions.  Her 
hospital course was without complications and she was given 
extensive discharge instructions and follow up care reminders.

irritated from clothing. The staples will stay in place until

symptoms of infection including: increasing redness at the 
incision, opening of the incision, increased pain at the 
incision line,draining of white/green/yellow/foul smelling 
drainage, or if you develop a fever. Please call the office if

symptoms are severe. You may shower, let the warm water run over 
the incision line and pat the area dry with a towel, do not rub.

instructed otherwise by Dr. ___. You may gradually 
increase your activity as tolerated but no heavy exercise until 
cleared by your doctor.

more than 3000 mg of Tylenol daily. Do not drink alcohol while
