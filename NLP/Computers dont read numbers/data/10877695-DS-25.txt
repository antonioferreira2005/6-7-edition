Chief Complaint:
Achalasia & hiatal hernia
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
laparoscopic ___ myotomy and hernia repair and revision 
hiatal hernia repair

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of reflux-type
symptoms who has been having intermittent episodes of dysphagia
as well as pain in her chest who was seen by Dr. ___ ___
years ago when we did think she indeed had esophageal 
dysmotility
proven with a upper GI swallow study, but did not think it was a
true achalasia at the time. It was also uncertain whether her
symptoms were from her moderate-sized hiatal hernia and thus was
treated nonoperatively. However, she reports that her symptoms
have become more severe since ___ in which she no longer
could keep fluids down and having coughing episodes especially 
at
nighttime when she is in recumbent position. On ___, her
repeat motility study had shown that there now was poor
esophageal peristaltic reserve in the esophageal body with 
normal
___ pressure and failure of ___ (Type II
achalasia). She comes to us in clinic today with a slight
different complaint of not being able to keep down pills for
months at night. She was recently hospitalized for pneumonia at
___ and ___ bronchiectasis and still resolving R lobe
pneumonia on CT on ___. Pulmonologist thinks this is
aspiration, and she has complained for months of nocturnal
vomiting, not keeping down pills for months before these other
episodes. She has received a GI botox injection on ___ 
and
more recently on ___ and reports that her symptoms improve
for a few months and return to baseline. She complains of
epigastric pain and discomfort after she eats and frequently
coughs up or throws up her food after consumption. She is 
seeking
a surgical option for her discomforts now. Otherwise, she is
feeling well and has no other complaints. Now that
her symptoms have exacerbated and indeed has achalasia, it seems
that it is time for her to get surgery. Due to the fact that she
not only has achalasia, but a hiatal hernia, we believed that it
would be more ideal for her to get ___ myotomy with 
possibly
Toupet and hiatal hernia repair at the same time as opposed to a
balloon dilatation alone. She agreed and wished to proceed with 
surgery.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ presented to pre-op holding at ___ on ___ a 
___ myotomy and hiatal hernia repair. She tolerated the 
procedure well without complications (Please see operative note 
for further details). After a brief and uneventful stay in the 
PACU, the patient was transferred to the floor for further 
post-operative management. On POD3, the patient continued to 
have some dysphagia, which was confirmed with a upper GI 
fluoroscopy study that showed no narrowing but slow passage of 
contrast. The decision was made to take her back to the OR for a 
revision of the hiatal hernia. (Please read operative note for 
further details).  A portion of fundus had reherniated above the 
diaphragm, which was reduced and the crura closed more tightly. 
 Neuro: Pain was well controlled on a dilaudid PCA which was 
subsequently switched to po pain meds that included ibuprofen 
suspension, oxycodone, and Tylenol.
 CV: Vital signs were routinely monitored during the patient's 
length of stay. 
 Pulm: The patient was encouraged to ambulate, sit and get out 
of bed, use the incentive spirometer, and had oxygen saturation 
levels monitored as indicated.  
 GI: The patient was initially kept NPO after the procedure. The 
patient was later advanced to a regular diet on POD2, but she 
continued to have difficulty swallowing and so was taken back to 
the OR for a revision of her hiatal hernia. POD1 from the second 
procedure, she was advanced to clears and regular diet and 
tolerated a regular diet at time of discharge. She was to not 
consume chips or bread during the hospital stay and at least 
until her next follow-up appointment.
 GU: Patient had a Foley catheter that was removed on POD1 for 
both of her procedures. For her first procedure, she failed to 
void after she was straight cathed onced and had a foley in. 
This foley was kept in until her next procedure and was pulled 
on POD1. She failed again to void but was ultimately able to 
void spontaneously after one straight cath. Urine output was 
monitored as indicated.
 ID: The patient's vital signs were monitored for signs of 
infection and fever. There were none.
 Heme: The patient had blood levels checked post operatively 
during the hospital course to monitor for signs of bleeding. The 
patient had vital signs, including heart rate and blood 
pressure, monitored throughout the hospital stay.  
 On ___, the patient was discharged to home/rehab/etc. At 
discharge, he/she was tolerating a regular diet, passing flatus, 
stooling, voiding, and ambulating independently.  He/She will 
follow-up in the clinic in ___ weeks. This information was 
communicated to the patient directly prior to discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ 
___. You were admitted to our hospital for 
surgery . You had a laparoscopic ___ myotomy and hernia 
repair and then a revision hiatal hernia repair without 
complications. You tolerated the procedure well and are 
ambulating, stooling, tolerating a regular diet, and your pain 
is controlled by pain medications by mouth. You are now ready to 
be discharged to home. Please follow the recommendations below 
to ensure a speedy and uneventful recovery. 

ACTIVITY:
- Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
- You may climb stairs. You should continue to walk several 
times a day. 
- You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit. 
- You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as 
tolerated.
- Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first. 
- No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your 
surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. 

HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
- You may feel weak or "washed out" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
- You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the surgery.

YOUR BOWELS:
- Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine 
such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk 
of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
- If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.
- After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get 
diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of 
fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is 
severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
- You are being discharged with a prescription for **oxycodone 
for pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to 
exceed 3000mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after 
surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses 
if you are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may 
take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled 
by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics 
to help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly 
wean off these medications as tolerated. 
- Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.

If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon.
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness
- cough, shortness of breath, wheezing
- pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever
- shaking chills, fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
- nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or 
your medications
- if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, 
feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing)
-any change in your symptoms or any symptoms that concern you

MEDICATIONS:
- Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just 
as you did before, unless you have been told differently.
- If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not 
to take, please call your surgeon. 

WOUND CARE: 
- dressing removal:
-You may shower with any bandage strips that may be covering 
your wound. Do not scrub and do not soak or swim, and pat the 
incision dry. If you have steri strips, they will fall off by 
themselves in ___ weeks. If any are still on in two weeks and 
the edges are curling up, you may carefully peel them off. 
 Do not take baths, soak, or swim for 6 weeks after surgery 
unless told otherwise by your surgical team. 
-Notify your surgeon is you notice abnormal (foul smelling, 
bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site, 
opening of your incision, or increased pain or bruising. Watch 
for signs of infection such as redness, streaking of your skin, 
swelling, increased pain, or increased drainage.
