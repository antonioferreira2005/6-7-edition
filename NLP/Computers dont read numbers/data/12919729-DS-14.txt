History of Present Illness:
___ yo Female with scoliosis presents to ED with increasing pain 
and concern for broken spine implants.  Her scoliosis was 
intially operated on ___ at ___ with a 
thoracolumbar fusion.  She developed spinal pseudoarthrosis.  In 
___ it was noted on plain films that her right spinal 
rod was broken.  On ___, Dr. ___ operated to replace 
this rod, along with L4-L5 anterior lumbar fusion, and revision 
of L4-L5 hardware.  She had done well post-operatively but 
maintained a high narcotic requirment.  On ___, in clinic 
follow-up it was noted that she had a broken right rod.    Now, 
three days ago she was bending over at her house when she felt 
sharp pain very similiar to previous episodes of hardware 
failure. Since that time she reports that she has been in severe 
pain but without numbness/tingling, weakness, or bowel/bladder 
incontinence.  The pain is mainly in her lower back and radiated 
to anterior thighs.  She was determined to have hardware fatigue 
consistent with spinal nonunion at the thoracolumbar junction.   
She underwent evaluation including imaging which heightened 
suspicion of this nonunion diagnosis, and as such, she underwent 
conservative care.  Conservative care regimen was inadequate to 
reduce her symptoms to intolerable level, and symptoms were 
severe and interfering with activities of daily living and 
work-related activities including walking.  Due to the severity 
of her symptoms, and the refractory nature of the syndrome, as 
well as the natural history of this disorder, she elected to 
undergo surgical treatment.

___: T-spine, L-spine Xrays: Interval development of a 
fracture through the left ___ rod at the same level of 
the previously noted fracture through the right  ___ rod. 


___: Chest Xray: 
1. Ill defined opacity in the right lung base is nonspecific, 
and could represent atelectasis, but early infection or 
aspiration are not excluded and clinical correlation 
recommended.  
2. Low lung volumes accentuating bibasilar bronchovascular 
crowding. 
3. Fractured ___ rods, better depicted on same-day spine 
radiographs. 

___ Chest Xray:
AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in 
semi-erect position. Comparison is made with the next preceding 
supine single view chest examination of ___. The 
patient is status post surgical revision of fractured ___ 
spine stabilization rods. On the next preceding chest 
examination of ___, a suspicious right basal density 
was identified, raising the possibility of beginning pulmonary 
infiltrate. 
  On today's examination, this right-sided basal density in 
supradiaphragmatic position is again noted and appears to have 
increased. It is compatible with a pneumonic infiltrate. In 
addition, we have now a hazy diffuse density on the lung base, 
raising the suspicion of some pleural effusion. It apparently is 
related to a most recent surgical intervention as a row of 
cutaneous metallic surgical clips can be identified in 
left-sided paraspinal position.  No evidence of pneumothorax or 
conclusive signs of new parenchymal pulmonary infiltrates on the 
left side. A previously described right internal jugular vein 
approach central venous line remains in unchanged position. The 
site of the ___ rod fracture is at the lower edge of the 
image field and has not undergone any significant positional 
change. 

___ Chest Xray:
Right lower lobe consolidation is less dense. Left lower lobe 
consolidation is unchanged. There is better aeration of the 
upper lobes bilaterally. Moderate left pleural effusion is 
probably unchanged allowing for different position of the 
patient. Right pleural effusion is small. Thoracolumbar hardware 
is noted. Multiple skin staples are seen. 

___ Chest Xray:
The post-surgical changes in the thoracolumbar spine are stable. 
There is slight interval decrease in left pleural effusion with 
minimal improvement of the left basal aeration. The patient is 
in minimal interstitial engorgement, also improved since the 
prior study. Small amount of right pleural fluid cannot be 
excluded. 

___ Chest Xray:
Comparison with the previous study of ___. A small left 
pleural effusion with underlying compressive atelectasis and/or 
consolidation persists. There is mild prominence of 
bronchovascular markings, as before.  The heart and mediastinal 
structures are unchanged. Post-surgical change with bilateral 
rods and pedicle screws is again noted in the thoracolumbar 
spine. No significant interval change.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ___ Spine Surgery Service and 
taken to the Operating Room for repair of broken spine implants 
without complication. For details please refer to the dictated 
operative notes. Her postoperative course was complicated by 
fever and postoperative delirium.  Below are the issues of her 
postoperative course by problem:  

1. Pain control: Given her history of extensive polypharmacy, 
Pain services were consulted for assistance managing poor 
postoperative pain control. Pain regimen initially included a 
ketamine infusion and dilaudid PCA, which was ultimately weaned 
to an oral regimen of oxycontin 20mg BID and oxycodone 30mg 
every 3 hours.  Of note, her regimen pre-operatively was 
oxycodone 30mg every 4 hours.  Due to her high narcotic 
requirements, she was also maintained on an aggressive bowel 
regimen and had normal bowel movements prior to discharge.  

2. Delirium: Postoperatively, she was noted to be disoriented 
and intermittently agitated, wandering into wrong rooms, 
reporting visual hallucinations, and expressing paranoid 
ideation that staff were stealing her belongings and wearing 
them outside her room.  A code purple was called when she 
attempted to leave AMA, and Psychiatric evaluation determined 
that she did not have the capacity to do so.  An extensive 
workup was unrevealing, and her mental status returned to 
baseline with simplification of her medications and good pain 
control.  Her delirium was attributed to poly-pharmacy 
interaction and not psychosis.  

3. Fevers: She had recurrent fevers postoperatively without 
symptoms of infection.  She was treated empirically for 
pneumonia due to an infiltrate seen on CXR, but follow up the 
next day showed near resolution, and as she did not have any 
clinical evidence of pneumonia, the antibiotics were 
discontinued.  She was also treated for a simple UTI, but her 
fevers persisted. She was transferred to the medical service and 
antibiotics were discontinued. An extensive workup was 
unremarkable, and her fevers were attributed to a reactive 
process involving the bone morphologic protein placed 
intraoperatively.  Prior to discharge, she had remained afebrile 
for greater than 24 hours, and a final chest xray and urinalysis 
were unremarkable.  Blood cultures are pending from this 
hospitalization but have shown no growth to date. These will be 
followed up by the discharging hospitalist.

On discharge she had met all postoperative milestones with her 
pain well-controlled on the prescribed oral regimen.  She was 
discharged with instructions to follow up with Dr. ___ 
postoperative care.  She was also given information to make a 
primary care appointment for long-term follow up of her health 
care and chronic pain medication issues. The patient was 
instructed that she needed to identify 1 provider to write her 
chronic opioid medications. Currently, this is Dr. ___ 
she recognizes this can only be temporary and she needs to find 
a primary care physician or pain specialist to take over this 
responsibility.
