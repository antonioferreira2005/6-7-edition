Chief Complaint:

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with atrial fibrillation on
rivaroxaban who presents with an episode of loss of 
consciousness
and left sided weakness. Her daughter states that Ms. ___ came
over to her house at around 1pm. They were sitting outside, and
her daughter went inside to make lunch around 115pm. At 130pm,
she looked outside and saw that Ms. ___ had dropped her glass 
of
ice water. Her daughter went outside and found Ms. ___ slumped
over to the left. She did not respond to voice or light
stimulation. Her daughter then used more vigorous stimulation,
and Ms. ___ only groaned but did not open her eyes. EMS was
called, and when they arrived, Ms. ___ would still only groan 
to
vigorous stimulation but would not open her eyes or interact. 
Her
daughter feels that during this time, her left arm was weaker 
and
more floppy than the right, although they were both slack. In
addition, she feels that Ms. ___ had a slight left sided facial
droop, although was not sure because she was lying on that side.
She was placed in the ambulance and taken to an OSH. During the
ambulance ride, she was trying to open her eyes, and when they
reached the OSH, she was more alert. She started saying that she
was "going to go home" and that her "father was waiting for 
her",
but her father has been dead for ___ years. A head CT and labs
were unremarkable, and she was transferred to ___. En route to
___, Ms. ___ was acting more appropriately and was basically
back to herself.

Of note, apparently Ms. ___ had another episode earlier this
week. Her ___ came into her apartment and found her sitting in a
chair. She had a difficult time waking her up, but Ms. ___ was
apparently appropriate when she did and her vitals were within
normal. Therefore, her daughter was not told about this event.
 
On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred
vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness,
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties
producing or comprehending speech. Denies focal weakness,
numbness, parasthesiae.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with HTN, CHF, DM, and 
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presents from an outside 
hospital with LOC and R sided weakness. 

#Neuro: upon admission to ___, her neurological exam was 
non-focal. NCHCT and CT/CTA head/neck did not show acute 
intracranial abnormality. MRI did not show a stroke but did show 
diffuse white matter disease likely ___ chronic microangiopathy. 
She was continued on rivaraoxaban and aspirin per outpatient 
cardiologist. Differential of her presentation includes seizure 
given the large burden of white matter disease vs vasovagal 
syncope (dehydration and immediately drinking a glass of cold 
water leading to a vagal response) vs toxic-metabolic (?UTI). An 
extended routine EEG was negative. 

#CV: Ms. ___ had an acute exacerbation her CHF with worsening 
dyspnea the night of ___ likely ___ going into afib with RVR 
that was treated with metoprolol. A chest radiograph showed 
pulmonary vascular congestion. She was diuresed 5L and 
electrolytes were repleted prn.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted for loss of consciousness and perhaps left 
sided weakness that was initially concerning for a transient 
ischemic attack. Your MRI of your head did not show a stroke but 
did show extensive white matter disease. Because of this, a 
seizure workup was also performed. The EEG read was negative for 
seizures. 

You were also found to have some mild volume overload on your 
chest x-ray likely from your congestive heart failure. During 
your second night in the hospital, you had an episode of atrial 
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate where you heart rate 
went into the 150s. This was treated with metoprolol, and you 
did well. Unfortunately, this likely precipitated a heart 
failure exacerbation, which caused you to have some trouble 
breathing thus requiring oxygen. You were diuresed with IV Lasix 
and did well. 

None of your home medications were changed. Please follow up 
with your outpatient primary care physician. You will need a set 
of labs drawn tomorrow to check your potassium level. Please 
also follow up with your cardiologist.

It was a pleasure taking care of you, and we wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team
