RELEVANT STUDIES
========================
___ FOOT AP,LAT & OBL RIGHT:
No previous images.  There is extensive destruction about the 
fifth MCP joint involving the bony structures on both sides.  
Soft tissue prominence is seen and there is suggestion of gas 
within soft tissues on the plantar surface on the lateral view.  
All of these findings a findings are strongly suggestive of 
osteomyelitis. The remainder of the study is within normal 
limits with minimal inferior calcaneal spur. 

___ TUNNELED CENTRAL LINE PLACEMENT:
Successful placement of a single-lumen Hickman tunneled line via 
the right 
internal jugular venous approach. The tip of the catheter 
terminates in the right atrium. The catheter is ready for use.

Ms. ___ is a ___ female with history of 
type II diabetes complicated by stage V CKD and osteomyelitis to 
___ metatarsal head with planned outpatient procedure for ___ 
metatarsal head resection who presents with anemia.

ACUTE ISSUES
# ___ Metatarsal Head Osteomyelitis:
# Skin and soft tissue infection 
Patient is s/p right foot resection of ___ metatarsal head, 
resection ___ toe base, excision and closure plantar ulcer by 
podiatry on ___. Pathology showed no acute inflammation 
at the right ___ metatarasal base or margin. She was started 
empirically on cefazolin and briefly on Vancomycin due to 
concern for wound cutulres that grew MSSA and enterococcus. It 
was felt that her enterococcus was likely contaminant and the 
Vancomycin was stopped. She had a tunneled central line placed 
for a 2-week course of IV cefazolin. She will require dressing 
changes every other day with betadine to foot and will follow 
with podiatry.

# Anemia
Patient had a Hb of 4.4 fingerstick which was felt to be likely 
a false reading. She was transfused with 2U leukoreduced RBCs. 
Repeat Hb in ED was 6.3 prior to transfusion, with a baseline 
between ___. It appears likely that her anemia is secondary to 
her CKD, anemia of chronic disease and chronic foot ulcer. Her 
guaiac was negative, hemolysis labs have been negative, RBC 
morphology grossly normal. Her hemoglobin was stable and 6.9 on 
discharge. After discussion with her outpatient nephrologist, it 
was felt that her low Hb was in the setting of recent surgery 
and that the risks of transfusion (including increased rejection 
of eventual transplanted kidney) outweighed the benefit. She 
will start Epogen and Iron as an outpatient after starting 
dialysis. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Stage V CKD
# Hyperphosphatemia
Her Torsemide was held prior to surgery and restarted after. 

# DMII: Not currently on any medications.
- Patient states that she previously had diabetes that was well 
controlled with diet. She has been consistently within normal 
range for the past 24 hours. She takes no home antihyperglycemic 
meds, takes no home insulin. She did not require insulin during 
hospitalization. 

# Hypertension
She was non-adherent to her home meds which included HCTZ and 
amlodipine. She was uptitrated to 10mg amlodipine daily.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
[] Aspirin 81 was stopped for primary prevention. Please have 
PCP discussion regarding whether it is appropriate to restart. 
[] She was not taking hydralazine or Metoprolol. These were d/c 
as her blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and should be 
restarted as clinically indicated. 
[] She was not taking Veltassa. This was d/c as she was not 
hyperkalemic and should be restarted as clinically indicated. 
[] Continue cefazolin 2g IV Q24H until ___ for treatment of 
osteomyelitis
[] Recheck CBC, BMP at next PCP visit
