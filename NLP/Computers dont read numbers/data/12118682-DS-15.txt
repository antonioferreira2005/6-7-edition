# Chest Pain
# CAD s/p stent x2 w known in-stent restenosis 
Cardiac cath was done ___ and showed: Normal left and right 
heart filling pressures. Three vessel coronary artery disease, 
including distal small om occlusion to small for intervention. 
Negative iFR and IVUS of pRCA that did not explain rest 
symptoms. Chest pain was believed to be musculoskeletal vs from 
small distal OM or microvessel disease. She was initiated on 
high dose atorvastatin 80mg daily and her metoprolol was 
switched to metoprolol succinate 50mg daily as titration up of 
antianginal.

# DM
very poorly controlled with an A1c of 13%. She was placed on 
home glargine 33 units before bed and Humalog insulin sliding 
scale while in house. Held home Trulicity as nonformulary

CHRONIC ISSUES:
================
# Hypertension - cont home losartan 
# Hyperlipidemia - cont high-dose atorvastatin 
# Depression - cont home citalopram, monitor QTc
# GERD - cont home ranitidine

GREATER THAN 30 MINUTES SPENT ON DC PLANNING

[ ] MEDICATION CHANGES:
-Added: Atorvastatin 80, metoprolol succinate 50
-Stopped: Metoprolol tartrate (replaced with succinate), 
rosuvastatin (replaced with atorvastatin)

[ ] FOLLOW-UP LABS:
-Low TSH noted on admission labs - c/f subclinical 
hypothyroidism. Should be repeated in outpatient setting

[ ] FOLLOW UP WORKUP FOR CHEST PAIN:
-No clear coronary etiology for chest pain was determined. Pt 
would benefit from workup and treatment for likely 
musculoskeletal etiology vs assessment of improvement with high 
intensity statin if microvessel disease

[ ] FOLLOW UP DIZZINESS:
-Pt with intermittent dizziness during hospitalization here, 
orthostatic vital signs negative for volume depletion. Consider 
outpatient workup for causes of same.
