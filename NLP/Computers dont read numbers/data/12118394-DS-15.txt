Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with DM2, OSA, CHF (EF25%), 
with recent hospitalization ___ for pneumonia/CHF/renal 
failure who presents from rehab due to altered mental status.  

#AMS - He appeared sleepy but was arousable to voice.  He was 
A&Ox3 (name, ___ and date).  He had episodes that were 
similar to this during his last admssion, and they occurred 
after he didn't wear CPAP for a night.  When he is compliant 
with CPAP his mental status is much better.  It is imperative 
that he wear his CPAP mask each night when sleeping as his 
mental status is very sensitive to this.  His ABG showed that 
his CO2 level was the same as at discharge, suggesting this is 
not CO2 narcosis.  There was also no evidence of infection to 
cause his AMS.  CT head at admission showed no acute changes.

#OSA - Should wear CPAP at night, as decribed above, he becomes 
very sleepy during the day when he is not compliant with this.

#CHF (EF=25%) - He had crackles in his lungs at admission but 
duiresed 2000cc during the first 12 hours of admission.  He had 
been given IVF at rehab prior to admission which likely caused 
this.  He has been diuresing well on his home dose of Lasix and 
will continue this at discharge.

#T2DM - He was continued on his home dose of insulin and sugars 
remained reasonably well controlled.

#Chronic kidney disease - Creatinine had improved from the time 
of previous discharge.

#COPD - No wheezing on exam and no SOB.  He was continued on his 
home regimen of Spiriva and Advair with PRN nebs.

#Depression - Continued his home Celexa and Cymbalta.

#Code status - FULL CODE

#Transitional issues
-Is is crucial that he wear CPAP at night, otherwise he is more 
confused and somnolent during the day
-Has follow-up scheduled with nephrology after discharge
-His ACEi and spironolactone were held after last admission, 
these should be re-evaluated by his nephrologist as to whether 
they can be restarted
-Monitor for serotonin syndrome given cymbalta/zoloft 
combination
-Should be evaluated for AICD as an outpatient
-Please continue checking weekly Chem-10 while at rehab
