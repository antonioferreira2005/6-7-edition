Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on ___ to the General Surgical

obstruction. Patient was initially managed conservatively with 
bowel rest. He had a nasogastric tube inserted and was NPO/ IV 
fluids with antiemetics for nausea. On ___ the patient had a 
colonoscopy performed along with dilitation of the ileocolonic 
anastamosis. Following the procedure the patient continued to be 
NPO and on IV fluids. Over the course of the next few days the 
patient had episodes of emesis of both "feculent material" and 
bilious material. A repeat CT scan on ___ showed progression 
of the small bowel obstruction with dilatation of the small 
bowel loops up to 5.3 cm from the previous 4.1 cm. The patient 
had a PICC line inserted and was started on TPN. On ___ he 
was taken to the operating room for an intestinal bypass. The 
operation went well without complication. Please refer to the 
Operative Note for details. After a brief, uneventful stay in 
the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids, 
with a foley catheter, and an epidural and PCA for pain control. 
 The patient was hemodynamically stable.His hospital course 
following the jejunocolostomy is described below:

Neuro: The patient received an epidural and pca with good effect 
and adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the 
patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. The patient 
complained of pain with several pain medication regimens. His 
pain was well controlled with Methadone PO 10 mg q 8 hours and 
methadone IV 10 mg every 8 hours. The patient was discharged on 
this regimen and advised not to take any of his home 
narcotics(morphine), sedatives, or alcohol with this medication. 
The patient was neurologically stable during this admission.
CV: Following the operation the patient had episodes of sinus 
tachycardia with heart rates as high as 130-140's. Patient was 
asymptomatic and continued to produce good urine output. Over 
the following days the patient's tachcardia improved and fell to 
the low 100's  and high 90's. He was started on metoprolol 25 mg 
bid and was discharged on this medication. Patient was 
hypertensive throughout this hospital admission with blood 
pressures as elevated as high 160's/ high 80's. He does have a 
past medical history of hypertension. Vital signs were routinely 
monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO/TPN/IV 
fluids. The patient tolerated the TPN well and as his bowel 
function returned his diet was advanced appropriately. Patient's 
intake and output were closely monitored, and IV fluid was 
adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were routinely followed, 
and repleted when necessary. Given that he was experiening 
frequent bowel movements of 5 loose bowel movements per day, he 
was restarted on Lomotil 1 tablet every 4 hours as needed for 
diarrhea with a goal of no more than 2 bowel movements per day. 
Patient had his indwelling foley removed on post-op day 4 when 
his epidural was removed. Patient had no difficulty voiding 
afterwards. Patient was transitioned to a regular diet and was 
taken off TPN. He had no issues tolerating the regular diet. 
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection. Wound was routinely 
monitored and showed no signs of infection.
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout 
his stay;
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin;He was 
encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan. He was discharged with 
nursing for ___ care with the understanding that his PICC would 
likely be removed on ___ in his followup visit with Dr. 
___. He received 1 B12 injection while in house and was 
advised that he would need these injections monthly as an 
outpatient. Patient was instructed that his narcotic regimen and 
metoprolol would be adjusted with his PCP or oncologist on the 
follow-up visit. His oncologist was verbally informed about the 
plan and agreed to manage his narcotics on an outpatient basis.
