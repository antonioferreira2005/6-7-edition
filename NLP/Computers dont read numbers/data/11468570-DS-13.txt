Labs reviewed: mild hyperglycemia

Imaging: CT abdomen/pelvis (___) - IMPRESSION:  
1.  Extensive colonic diverticulosis without evidence for acute 
diverticulitis.  Normal appendix. 
2.  8 mm pancreatic head hypodensity with apparent connection to 
the pancreatic duct, suggestive of an IPMN.  No pancreatic 
ductal dilation. MRCP could be performed for further evaluation, 
if clinically indicated. 
3.  1.7 cm segment VI hepatic lesion, likely reflecting a 
hemangioma but incompletely characterized on this single phase 
examination. 
4.  Multiple left lower lobe pulmonary nodules, measuring up to 
0.8 cm. Recommend follow-up chest CT in 3 months to document 
stability. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT
___ y/o F w/ HTN, XOL, hypothyroidism and depression who p/w 3 
days of gradual onset, progressive, severe, constant lower 
abdominal and central lumbar back pain which was not relieved 
with NSAIDs, but was relieved with IV morphine and was not 
associated with any other signs, symptoms, or laboratory studies 
of note. 

After admission, she became pain free.
We performed an x-ray of her lumbar spine and her hip given 
location of the pain.  She had severe degenerative disease of 
the lumbar spine and some degenerative changes in her hips, but 
no fractures were identified.   Her pain is likely secondary to 
degenerative disc disease, and she may need steroid injections 
and/or pain control +/- referral to a spine physician for 
further assessment.

A CT abdomen/pelvis was also performed which revealed an IPMN as 
follows:
1.  Extensive colonic diverticulosis without evidence for acute 
diverticulitis.  Normal appendix. 
2.  8 mm pancreatic head hypodensity with apparent connection to 
the 
pancreatic duct, suggestive of an IPMN.  No pancreatic ductal 
dilation.  MRCP 
could be performed for further evaluation, if clinically 
indicated. 
3.  1.7 cm segment VI hepatic lesion, likely reflecting a 
hemangioma but 
incompletely characterized on this single phase examination. 
4.  Multiple left lower lobe pulmonary nodules, measuring up to 
0.8 cm.  
Recommend follow-up chest CT in 3 months to document stability. 

Given IPMN, she may benefit from evaluation by GI with either 
MRCP or EUS.   There were no concerning features re: her IPMN 
while hospitalized.

At time of discharge, she was pain-free.   She was found, 
however, to have sinus tachycardia to 110 bpm with no associated 
chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or lightheadedness, 
and she was able to ambulate without difficulty.   She will have 
PCP follow up following discharge; appointment pending.  

For osteoporosis, she was told to increase her vitamin D to 1000 
U daily in addition to her prescribed bisphosphanate.  

Other issues:
# HTN - poorly controlled on admission
- likely multifactorial (pain, missed dose of lisinopril)
- hypertension improved modestly with administration of 20 mg PO 
lisinopril (twice the patient's home dose)

# Liver mass
- 1.7 cm segment VI hepatic lesion, likely reflecting a 
hemangioma but incompletely characterized on this single phase 
examination. PCP ___ recommended.

# Lung masses
- patient will need ___ CT scan in 3 months

# Hypothyroidism
- continued home levothyroxine

# Depression/anxiety
- ontinued home citalopram
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

You were admitted with back and abdominal pain.   Your lab work 
was normal.  However, on x-ray we did see that you have 
significant degenerative disease of your lumbar spine which may 
require pain control and/or steroid injections / interventions 
in the future.  You should discuss this with your primary care 
physician.

We also noted that you had an abnormality in the pancreas called 
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) which requires 
further imaging.   Sometimes, these areas can go on to become 
cancerous in the future, so evaluating these areas is important. 
 Your primary care will help direct the next step.
