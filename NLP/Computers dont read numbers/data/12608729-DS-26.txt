Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain  
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old woman with PMH significant for Crohn's disease, 
sarcoidosis, history of SBOs, chronic back and abdominal pain
presenting with several day history of acute on chronic 
abdominal
pain with, also with coffee-ground stools with clots and
associated syncopal episode.

Patient was in her relatively usual state of health until 3 days
prior when she noticed acute worsening of her chronic abdominal
pain. At baseline, patient states that she has chronic abdominal
pain that has been ongoing for at least a year that occurs 
almost
every day, exacerbated by eating. Starting ___, her
abdominal pain worsened as is currently severe. Describes
___ abdominal pain that is stabbing, also with 
burning
sensation. Has chronic nausea at baseline for which she takes
Zofran PRN, and also still has vomiting about every 4 days which
has been chronic. Also still with unchanged chronic diarrhea 
that
she describes as watery.

Yesterday while she was having a bowel movement, describes it as
"coffee ground" and black. Felt very lightheaded and called her
daughter. States she passed out while talking with her daughter
and next thing she remembers was waking up after her daughter
arrived. Denied any chest pain, palpitations surrounding event,
no tongue bite or urinary incontinence. Subsequently presented 
to
___ ED, however not satisfied with care there and subsequently
presented here. 
 
In the ED, initial vitals were: T 97.7 HR 88 BP 191/100 RR 18 O2
98%RA
 
Exam notable for:  
Uncomfortable, no acute distress
Head NC/AT
RRR, systolic murmur
CTA bilaterally
Abdomen distended, soft, diffuse tenderness most pronounced in
RLQ, voluntary guarding, no rebound, hyperactive bowel sounds
Brown stool, guaiac negative
Skin warm and dry

Labs notable for:  
- CBC 8.4, Hb 12.1, PLT 176
- Na 143, K 3.7, Cl 112, bicarb 17, Cr 0.8
- CRP 0.5
- LFTs: ALT 30, AST 59, ALP 85, T. bili 0.2
- Lipase 73
- UA bland

Imaging was notable for: 
CT A/P WC: 
Moderately dilated cecum with a likely transition point in the
right mid abdomen (series 2, image 43, 48), concerning for cecal
bascule. There are fluid-filled loops of small bowel proximally
without significant dilatation. No free fluid in the pelvis.
Normal bowel wall enhancement

Patient was given:  
___ 00:03 IVF  NS  
___ 00:11 IV Morphine Sulfate 4 mg

___ 06:10 IV Morphine Sulfate 4 mg 

Consults:
- GI: By report CT shows SBO. Recommended CRS consult, NNPO, 
IVF,
CRP, IV cipro/flagyl, NG decompression for which patient refused
NG tube placement

- CRS: CT scan not consistent with obstructive pattern as small
bowel decompressed and colon dilated throughout; most consistent
with chronic colon dilation from pelvic floor dysmotility, which
can be treated as an outpatient.No indication for surgical
intervention. Dispo per ED.

control 

Subjective: Upon arrival to the floor, patient confirms the 
above

abdominal
pain feels like her Chron's pain, last flare ___ year prior.

IMAGING/STUDIES

___ CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Dilated cecum with a possible transition point in the right 
mid abdomen (series 2, image 43, 48), raising possibility of a 
cecal bascule. 
2. There are dilated fluid-filled loops of small bowel 
proximally with an 
apparent transition point in the mid lower abdomen, suggestive 
of a partial small bowel obstruction. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with PMH significant for 
Crohn's disease, history of multiple SBOs, pelvic floor 
dysmotility, sarcoidosis, chronic back and abdominal pain 
presenting with several day history of acute on chronic 
abdominal pain, also with coffee-ground stools with clots and 
associated syncopal episode. Had CT A/P on admission showing 
dilated cecum with possible transition point concerning for SBO. 
However on further review with colorectal surgery, imaging did 
not support acute obstruction given her small bowel was 
decompressed and colon was dilated throughout. Given recent anal 
manometry testing showing elevated pressures and pelvic floor 
dysmotility was thought to have chronic dilation in the setting 
of pelvic floor dysmotility. Continued to have bowel movements 
and was passing gas, abdominal pain free at discharge. 

ACUTE ISSUES
=================
#Chronic Colon Dilation
#Pelvic Floor Dysmotility - With history of Crohns and prior 
SBO's presenting with several day history of acute on chronic 
abdominal pain with coffee-ground stool and associated syncopal 
episode. She initially had a CT A/P read as moderately dilated 
cecum with bascule and likely transition point in R mid abdomen, 
and patient was given IV ciprofloxacin and Flagyl. Colorectal 
surgery was consulted and on further review of CT imaging, was 
not consistent with obstructive pattern as small bowel was 
decompressed and colon dilated throughout, likely chronic 
dilation from pelvic floor dysmotility (recent anorectal 
manometry notable for high resting anal sphincter pressure with 
pelvic floor dysfunction). She had initially refused NGT 
decompression in ED. Reassuringly patient continued to have 
bowel movements and was passing gas during hospitalization, 
abdominal exam was not peritoneal. Given inpatient surgical 
management was not indicated, patient was trialed clears which 
she tolerated, diet was advanced, and was re-started on bowel 
regimen with standing MiraLAX and Colace. GI was consulted, with 
recommendations to discontinue IV abx and continue with her 
fentanyl patch for which she takes due to chronic pain. Crohn's 
flare was considered unlikely as CRP was not elevated, CT 
unremarkable for inflammation, and recent colonoscopy without 
findings of Crohn's. It was recommended  that she follow up with 
outpatient PR for pelvic floor physical  therapy to improve her 
symptoms. Given the improvement in her symptoms, passing gas and 
bowel movements and tolerating a diet the patient felt 
comfortable with discharge home and outpatient follow-up. 

#Syncope - Patient presented after syncopal episode in setting  
of bowel movement and passing "coffee-ground stool" per the 
patient. H/H stable in the hospital.  Likely vasovagal in the 
setting of bowel movement. Was  initially ordered for a TTE as 
part of syncope work-up given  II/VI systolic murmur on exam, 
however patient refused TTE. She  also refused telemetry as she 
reported that her "heart is fine, it has been evaluated". After 
obtaining collateral from PCP, patient has a known history of 
tricuspid regurgitation (last TTE in ___ and her murmur is not 
new. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
==================
#Chronic Pain - With history of chronic mid back, lower back, 
and right hip pain managed with fentanyl patch for mid and lower 
back pain and R hip pain. Previously had L4-L5 microdiscectomies 
from Dr. ___ she also had multiple epidural 
steroid injections including L3-L4 LESI and right L4 TFESI. She 
was continued on home fentanyl patch 75 mcg re-placed ___ ___, 
home baclofen 10mg TID, home Topamax 200mg PO BID, gabapentin 
300mg PO QHS. 

#Narcolepsy - Continued home modafinil 200mg PO QD that patient 
endorses taking PRN. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[ ] NEW/CHANGED MEDICATIONS
- None

[ ] Per CRS no surgical intervention. If indicated can refer to 
___ as an outpatient at GI follow-up if indicated

[ ] Will benefit from outpatient physical therapy per GI for 
pelvic floor dysmotility

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
  
It was a pleasure caring for you at ___

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You were admitted to the hospital because you were having 
abdominal pain and fainted after having a bowel movement.

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?  
-You received a CT scan which showed you had a lot of gas in 
your abdomen with chronic dilation, but we did not think this 
was caused by an obstruction.
-After speaking with your primary care doctor, we determined 
that your fainting was unlikely to be caused by your heart and 
was likely because you were having a bowel movement.

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  
-Please continue to take all of your medications as prescribed 
and follow-up with your appointments as listed below.

We wish you the best!  

Sincerely,
