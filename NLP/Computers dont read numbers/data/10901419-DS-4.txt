IMAGING:
MRI abdomen (___):
IMPRESSION: 
1. There is a large left renal mass measuring up to 8.7 cm, with 
extension 
into the left adrenal gland and contiguous with conglomerate 
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, which compresses and narrows 
the infrarenal IVC, though without thrombus. There is moderate 
left hydronephrosis. 
2. A 4.3 cm minimally peripherally enhancing mass in the right

3. A 1.9 cm lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney is 
consistent with a ___ IIF lesion. 
4. A paraesophageal T2 hyperintense rim enhancing cystic 
structure is 
nonspecific, and may represent a bronchogenic cyst.

CT Angiography Abdomen and Pelvis With Contrast
FINDINGS: Aorta: The abdominal aorta is normal in course and
caliber. No
abdominal aortic dissection. Celiac trunk and mesenteric
arteries: The celiac artery, superior
mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery are patent
without significant stenosis. Renal
arteries: Solitary right renal artery is patent without
significant stenosis. There are 2 left renal
arteries, both are patent without significant stenosis. Right
iliac arteries: The right common
iliac, external iliac, and internal iliac arteries are patent
without significant stenosis. Left
iliac arteries: The left common iliac, external iliac, and
internal iliac arteries are patent
without significant stenosis. Other veins: The left renal vein 
is
either surrounded by or directly
invaded by tumor. Liver: Hypodense mass in the right liver
measuring approximately 3.5 cm.
Gallbladder and bile ducts: The gallbladder is unremarkable.
Pancreas: The pancreas is unremarkable.

renal lesion is too small to accurately characterize. A left
renal mass at the renal hilum with
calcifications measures 7.5 x 7 cm. The left renal mass

retroperitoneum and the left adrenal gland. There is
hypoenhancement of the left renal cortex. There
is marked left hydronephrosis. The right ureter is unremarkable.

significant fluid collection.
Retroperitoneal space: There is thickening of
Gerota's fascia. There are soft tissue density nodules in the
anterior para renal space. Lymph
nodes: There is extensive para-aortic lymphadenopathy.
Conglomerate lymph node mass measures
approximately 5 x 3.1 x 7 cm. Bladder: The urinary bladder is
unremarkable. Reproductive:
Unremarkable as visualized. Bones/joints: No acute fracture. No
dislocation. Soft tissues: There is a small fat-containing
umbilical hernia. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Left renal neoplasm measuring approximately
7.5 cm. There is extensive retroperitoneal tumor, metastatic
lymphadenopathy and metastases in the anterior para renal space. 

2. Liver mass. Metastasis suspected. 
3. Marked left hydronephrosis, due
to mass effect from large hilar mass. 
4. Left renal vein either surrounded by or directly invaded by
tumor.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
___ yo M PMHx HTN who p/w acute on chronic left flank pain, found 
to have large left renal mass with severe left hydronephrosis, 
___, and imaging with concern for metastatic disease (to liver), 
now s/p biopsy of liver lesion. 

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:

# Left renal mass
Concerning for malignancy based on imaging findings.  
Complicated
by hydronephrosis and ___. Imaging revealed a liver lesion 
consistent with a metastasis which was biopsied. CEA was 
elevated at 59. CA ___ was
low/normal. His left flank pain was controlled with lidocaine 
patches, Tylenol, and oxycodone (used sparingly). 
[ ] F/u results of liver biopsy pathology

# ___ vs. CKD (unclear baseline)
# Left hydronephrosis
FeUrea and FeNa were consistent with pre-renal etiology likely 
due to poor PO intake in the setting of flank pain. Cr improved 
with IV fluids and encouraging PO intake. Baseline Cr appears to 
be 1.4-1.6.   

# HTN, poorly controlled
His home amlodipine was continued. In addition, HCTZ 25 mg daily 
and labetalol 200 mg BID were started with improved control.

# Access to care
Pt primarily resides in ___ and is just here for the 
holidays. He will need to establish care with a PCP in ___. 
He is also unsure of his insurance status.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were admitted to the hospital for flank pain and you were 
found to have a left kidney mass. You were also found to have 
spots in your liver that are concerning for spread of the kidney 
mass to the liver. You had a biopsy of one of the liver lesions 
completed on ___. The pathology from that biopsy is still 
pending at discharge.
Your blood pressure was also quite elevated and you were treated 
with new medications to control your blood pressure. You should 
continue to take those at home.
Your kidney function also fluctuated while you were in the 
hospital but responded well to fluid. You should make sure that 
you stay very hydrated to protect your kidneys. You should also 
not take NSAID medications (like ibuprofen - Motrin and Tylenol) 
because those can injure the kidney further.
The most important thing will be to establish a primary care 
doctor in ___ so the records from this hospital stay and the 
pathology results can be sent to a doctor there.
Best wishes for your continued health.
Take care,
Your ___ Care Team
