Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with PMH significant 
for HTN, HLD, DM2, schizoaffective disorder who is being sent in 
from PCP office with hyperglycemia and inability to take care of 
herself at home. 
 
# DM2/hyperglycemia: The patient's sugars have been very 
uncontrolled, mostly in the setting of her not taking her 
insulin because she ran out of needles. However, will need to 
exclude underlying infection, as well. The patient had dysuria 
and increased frequency this past weekend, but UA from this 
admission bland, urine culture pending. Patient's home insulin 
regimen was continued with good result.  Her blood sugars 
dropped from >500 on admission to the 100's on discharge.  A 
follow up appointment was established with both ___ and ___ 
PCP to further discuss her insulin regimen and whether it can be 
simplified.  She is currently on 3 different insulins, and while 
she understands her medications accurately, it may be 
overwhelming for her.  
  
# Weight loss/failure to thrive: The patient's providers are 
concerned about weight loss. Documented to weigh 183 pounds in 
___, and down to 159 this month. She has reported significant 
barriers to getting adequate food given that there is no one 
aournd to help her and she is totally dependent on the Ride to 
get to the grocery store and the pharmacy for her medications. 
Her schizoafective disorder may also be worsening as of late per 
her last social work note, and is possibly contributing to 
disorganization and inability to care for herself.  She is also 
a little unsure about what she should eat given her diabetes, 
and frequently feels unwell, likely due to persistant 
hyperglycemia/low insulin.  However, given history of colon 
cancer as well as benign ovarian mass, we obtained a CT abdomen 
and pelvis to rule out new malignancy as an etiology for weight 
loss.  CT scan did not show obstruction or mass. Patient should 
follow up with her regular oncologist as planned going forward. 

# Schizoaffective disorder: likely contributing to weight loss, 
failure to thrive and inability to take medications reliably as 
above.  Social worker, psychiatrist and PCP all agree the 
patient would do better in assisted living.  On presentation to 
the hospital the patient was alert, oriented x3, somewhat 
tangential and distracted but easy to redirect.  She could 
answer questions apprpriately.  No depression or thoughts of 
self harm. No frank delusions or hallicinations, although she is 
somewhat preoccupied with the idea that her neighbors are 
loitering outside her apartment and trying to eavesdrop on her.  
Per conversation with PCP she ___ does not live in that 
safe of a location, and for this reason as well may do better in 
assisted living. Her home psychiatric medications were continued 
during this admission. 
 
# Hyponatremia: The patient was noted to be hyponatremia today 
to 126, but after correcting for her glucose, sodium 136.  
 
# HTN: Home atenolol and lisinopril were continued, blood 
pressure was stable. 

# HLD: Home statin was continued.  
 
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Patient's safety and ability to care for herself at home is 
questionable.  Per SW, a friend is helping her look into 
assisted living facilities. 
-please ensure f/u CT scan read with oncologist and f/u 
colonscopy
-please monitor patient's weight given recent weight loss
-please ensure psychiatry f/u
-please consider toxoplasmosis screen if patient becomes acutely 
confused given history of cat litter exposure consistently
-please ensure blood glucose monitoring given persistently high 
blood sugars in 500s and poor compliance
-please ensure ___ f/u with HbA1c value of 13.5%
-please f/u iron studies with regards to patient's anemia
-please f/u TSH results
-please ensure daily ___ services continue as patient unable to 
take her own medications
