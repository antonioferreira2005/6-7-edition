Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___: 

It was a pleasure caring for you.  You were admitted with 
diarrhea and signs of alcohol withdrawal.  

You were treated for your alcohol withdrawal and improved over 
several days.  You were noted to have low electrolytes 
(potassium, magnesium, phosphate), also likely caused by 
alcohol.  We gave you back these electrolytes and they are now 
normal.  

For your diarrhea, you underwent testing that showed you have an 
infection called C difficile Colitis, a type of bacteria that 
causes diarrhea.  You were treated with antibiotics and 
improved.  

You are now ready for discharge.

Of note, during this admission you were found to have blood in 
your urine.  We have notified your primary care doctor about 
this.  Please discuss it with them at your next visit. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
