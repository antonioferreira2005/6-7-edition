Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ year old man with a history of CAD
(CABG ___, NSTEMI ___ with med management), chronic stable
angina, moderate AS, bladder cancer s/p resection, CKD, RCC s/p
nephrectomy, anxiety and IBS who presented to ___ emergency
department with chest pain and found to have an NSTEMI. Cath 
showed effective , decision was made to manage medically due to 
no clear culprit lesion, and technical difficulty of attempting 
PCI. His course was complicated by ___ on CKD due to
postrenal ureteral stenosis, now s/p ureteral stent, with
resolving ___ 

# NSTEMI  
# CAD s/p CABG  
Known history of stable angina, with NSTEMI in ___ that
showed patent grafts and severe native vessel disease. Given the
complexity of a possible PCI, he has been medically managed 
since
that time with stable to slightly worsening symptoms. On the day
prior to admission, developed angina and found to have NSTEMI
with troponin-T 0.09 -> 0.20 -> 0.33 prior to angiography. 
Angiography did not demonstrate significant change from ___
study, so will plan to medically manage. His TTE was also not
significantly changed from prior.  Patient has remained chest
pain-free on medical therapy since that time. He will be 
discharged on aspirin, rosuvastatin, metoprolol, IMDUR, and 
ranolazine. His Plavix was d/c-ed.

# Post Renal ___ on CKD stage III
# S/p Ureteral stent (on ___
Cr 1.6 at baseline. 2.3 on admission and 1.8 prior to 
angiography
with pre-hydration. Unclear what precipitated ___ prior to
admission, but good initial response to hydration so pre-renal 
etiology
is likely. Subsequently developed recurrent ___, and found to 
have hydronephrosis. Renal and urology consulted with ureteral 
stent placed on ___ for treatment of hydronephrosis. Post stent 
placement has seen improvement in Cr. Likely suffered from ATN, 
now in diuresis phase. 4.5L of urine on ___, 2 L or urine on 
___. Cr downtrended from 3.4 to 2.8 on
___ and ___, and 2.5 on ___. Also had hyperkalemia on ___, 
which resolved prior to discharge. Patient will keep R ureteral 
stent in place for ___ weeks, will follow up
with Dr. ___ in ___ clinic

#Bradycardia with beta blockade 
Patient has history of intolerance beta blocker with development 
of symptomatic bradycardia. As his angina has been refractory to 
medical therapy, decision was made to place PPM in order to 
uptitrate metoprolol for control of angina.

#Anemia 
Chronic normocytic anemia with a baseline Hgb ~10. Dropped to 
around
8.5 after cath. Pt vitals stable and no back pain, femoral bruit
or decreased distal pulse and Hgb was stable. CBC stable with 
Hgb
in the ___. S/P 1 unit blood ___ for aninga and upcoming
procedure.  Hemoglobin has been stable around 8 since this time.

#Aortic Stenosis
History of moderate AS. Almost severe on TTE compared to 
___.

#Thrombocytopenia: pt came in with plts of 150 with down 
trending
plt's. HIT score is low. Will monitor for ongoing plt 
dysfunction
or signs of bleeding. Platelets have been stable at 100-120. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
=================
# Bladder CA s/p resection:  
Followed by Dr. ___ in urology at ___. Path from
___ showing papillary urothelial carcinoma, low grade, non
invasive. Underwent ureteral stent placement, as above.

# GERD: home ranitidine
# Anxiety: continue sertraline  
# HTN: continue amlodipine  
# Polymyalgia rheumatica: Diagnosed ___. Currently off 
steroids, followed by ___ at ___ rheumatology.

Discharge Instructions:
 Dear Mr ___

 It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  

 WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
 ==========================  
 - You were admitted because you had a heart attack  
 
 WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
 ==============================  
  - You were admitted to the hospital because you had chest 
pain. You were found to have had a heart attack. Your heart 
arteries were examined (cardiac catheterization) which showed a 
blockage of one of the arteries. This was treated by 
medications.
  -Your kidney function decreased.  This was believed to be due 
to a blockage in the tube leading from the kidney to the 
bladder.  This was treated by our urology team placing a stent 
to open the blockage.

 WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
 ================================  
 - It is very important to take your normal aspirin, statin, 
metoprolol, isosorbide mononitrate, ranolazine to help manage 
your chest pain
 - It is important to follow up with all of your appointment 
scheduled, which you can find listed on this discharge sheet
 

 Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!  
 Your ___ Healthcare Team
