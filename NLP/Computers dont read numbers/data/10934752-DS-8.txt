Pertinent Results:
___ ECHO
PREBYPASS 
Preserved LV systolic funciton with LVEF > 55% and not SWMA. 
Severe AS with valve area < 1.0 cm2 and severe calcification of 
mitral valve - aortic valve interannular fibrosa with 
significant MV inflow obstruction. MV area by pressure half time 
is around 1.3-1.5 cm2, MVA by PISA is 1.0 cm2. Mean gradient is 
___ mmHg and peak grad is ___ mmHg for Mitral inflow 
consistent with severe MS. ___ left atrium is markedly dilated. 
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. There is 
severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at 
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic 
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe 
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). The mitral valve 
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate 
valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). There is at least 
moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient ___ mmHg) due 
to mitral annular calcification. There is no pericardial 
effusion. Normal TV and PV. Intact IAS. Normal coronary sinus. 

POSTBYPASS:
S/P AVR + CABG. Normally functioning AV prosthesis. No sig AS or 
AI. Otherwise Unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on ___ where 
the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and coronary 
artery bypass grafting. Please see operative note for details. 
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 2 found the 
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably. 
He did need aggressive pulmonary toilet and was kept in the unit 
for several days post op due to respiratory issues. He did use 
BIPAP at night and will need a sleep study as an outpatient to 
further assess OSA. The patient was neurologically intact and 
hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor 
support. Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently 
diuresed toward the preoperative weight. He did have post 
operative ATN and peak creatinine was 2.4. His baseline was 1.1 
and creatinine was 1.5 decreasing towards his baseline at the 
time of discharge. The patient was transferred to the telemetry 
floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were 
discontinued without complication. he developed post-operative 
atrial fibrillation and was treated with amiodarone and coumadin 
tehrpay. He developed serous drainage from his mid sternal pole 
and Kefzol was added.  He was afebrile and WBC was normal at the 
time discharge with scant old bloody sternal drainage from the 
distal pole (mid sternal drainage had resolved). The patient was 
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with 
strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 9 the 
patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain 
was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged 
to home in good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions.
