ceftriaxone. Hypernatremia and ___ were treated with IVF. Given 
advanced dementia and DNR/DNI status, ICD therapies were turned 
off. He had no significant improvement in mental status and 
family meeting was held. He was transitioned to comfort 
measures.

# COMFORT MEASURES ONLY. DNR/DNI. ICD therapies were turned off. 
He will be given scopolamine patch, morphine liquid, and 
lorazepam PO as needed for pain, anxiety, or respiratory 
distress.

a left lower facial droop. Code stroke was called, neuro 
consulted. CT head showed no major territorial infarction, 
hemorrhage or fracture. Shortly afterwards, patient was awake to 
name calling and painful stimuli. Etiology was likely 
toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, infection, electrolyte 
derangement. He was treated for these but did not improve.

# NUTRITION. Due to encephalopathy, he was not able to swallow 
or participate in meals initially and was made strict NPO by 
S&S. He was eventually upgraded to modified regular diet of thin 
liquids and ground solids, but was too somnolent to participate

intake from encephalopathy. We treated him with D5W IVF and his 
serum sodium slowly normalized to baseline levels. His last 
measured serum Na was 146 on ___.

# ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE:  Likely prerenal vs 
infection. Treated with IVF.  Baseline CKD stage III. Cr 2.3 on 
admission, baseline low to mid 1's.

# Bacteremia: Patient growing GPCs in clusters. Started on 
vancomycin ___, but stopped as it was felt to be contamination.

### CHRONIC ISSUES ###
# DM2: Chronic issue. Patient had higher blood glucose sticks 
than baseline with D5W. Treated with insulin. 

# ___ body dementia: Chronic progressive, advanced disease. No 
auditory or visual hallucinations during hospitalization. We 
held his trazadone and seroquel given his minimal 
responsiveness. We continued his perphenazine.

# CAD: Chronic issue. We continued his ASA and statin. He has 
ICD placed for history of NSVT and depressed EF. Given ongoing 
goals of care and progressive dementia, we discussed turning off 
his ICD with family and his outpatient cardiologist Dr. ___, 
___ were all in agreement. ICD therapies was turned off.
