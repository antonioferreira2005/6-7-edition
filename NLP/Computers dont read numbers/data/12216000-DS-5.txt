Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. Pain management - Patient had an epidural placed by APS for 
pain management. Patient was hypotensive, minimal response to 
IVF. Epidural -> PCA.

2. Post-op anemia due to blood loss - POD0 Hct 23.0, HR 110s -> 
Transfused 1 unit PRBCs. POD 2 Hct 21.1, asymptomatic. POD 3 Hct 
19.1, HR 110s, c/o mild dizziness, transfused 2 units PRBCs.

The patient received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the 
morning of POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the 
patient was voiding independently thereafter. The surgical 
dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was 
found to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal 
drainage. The patient was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs 
were checked throughout the hospital course and repleted 
accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating 
a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was afebrile with 
stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and 
pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen. The operative 
extremity was neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with posterior precautions.
