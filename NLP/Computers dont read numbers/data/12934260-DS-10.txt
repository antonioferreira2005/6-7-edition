RADIOLOGY STUDIES:
CT TORSO:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process, including no pulmonary 
embolus, acute 
aortic syndrome, or pneumonia. Minimal dependent atelectasis is 
noted. 
2. No acute intra-abdominal process. There is sigmoid and left 
colonic 
diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis or colitis. 
No abscess, 
free fluid or free air. 

CT HEAD:
No acute intracranial process, and no change from ___.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo woman with anxiety/depression, recent admission for 
colitis and UTI, who p/w abdominal pain/bloating in the setting 
of 3 days w/o a BM. Noted to have chest "fluttering" in the ED 
and an question of unresponsive episode. 

# CONSTIPATION/ABDOMINAL PAIN: Abdominal pain likely related to 
constipation. Patient started on miralax, docusate, bisacodyl, 
senna. She had BM after enema. In ED she did have CT abd/pelvis 
that showed diverticulosis no evidence of any acute process. In 
order to maintain regular bowel movements would suggest a high 
fiber diet, at least 1L of fluids per day and daily miralax and 
docusate. Would avoid senna, suppositories and other medications 
that cause urgency. Suspect that patient's multiple 
depression/anxiety meds could also be contributing to 
constipation symptoms and might be beneficial having her see her 
pscyhiatrist to discuss less constipating options.

# ATYPICAL CHEST PAIN: Likely represented anxiety. No e/o 
ischemia on ECG and neg troponins x 2. No further medical 
work-up suggested.

# Unresponsive Episode: This was unwitnessed. Pt unable to 
recall details of this event. Head CT was negative. Normal 
neurologic exam. No further episodes during this 
hospitalization.

# Peripheral Neuropathy: Continued gabapentin. As per last outpt 
neurology note, you can continue to titrate up as patient 
tolerates to as high as 

# Anxiety/depression: Continue home meds but schedule pt to f/u 
with outpt pyschiatrist or whomever prescribes psych meds to 
discuss changing to meds with fewer constipating side effects.
