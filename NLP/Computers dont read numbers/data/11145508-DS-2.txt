EPI-___. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout his admission.  He was also placed on q15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted.  He had 
restricted access to sharps. There were no safety issues or 
incidents during his admission.   

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Depression vs substance induced mood disorder vs bipolar 
disorder
On admission, patient endorsed labile mood, insomnia and 
anxiety.  Patient endorsed to the inpatient team extensive 
experimentation with street drugs ___, LSD, benzos, cocaine, 
mushrooms, frequent pot use and snorting his prescription 
Adderall) and extensive alcohol use.  Given ongoing substance, 
his presentation could be a result of substance use or an 
underlying depression exacerbated by substance use.  Per record 
brought in by the patient's parents, he also has been diagnosed 
with rapid cycling bipolar II.  He did endorse labile mood, but 
this could also be secondary to substance use and he did not 
appear manic or hypomanic on the unit.  He has been tried on 
multiple medications in the past including Lamictal, Abilify, 
Zoloft, Wellbutrin and Xanax.  Patient endorsed he didn't find 
any of these medications helpful for his mood, anxiety or sleep 
and that his current antidepressant, Remeron, has been the only 
helpful one.  He endorsed side effects with many of these 
medications that he couldn't tolerate.  He was continued on 
Remeron as he has found this medication helpful.  Patient's mood 
improved as he found the inpatient unit "low stress".  His SI 
diminished.  His sleep continued to be a problem despite 
trazadone and vistaril.  However, he endorsed never sleeping 
well through out his life and has seen a sleep specialist in the 
past.     

#) ADHD
Patient reports history of ADHD and takes Adderall at home.  
Patient was not given Adderall as an inpatient.  Given his 
reported history of mis-use of Adderall, will recommend not 
re-starting Adderall in the outpatient setting and to consider 
alternatives such as study and organizational skills classes and 
non-stimulant medications.  

#) Anxiety
Patient endorses feeling anxious frequently and seems to get 
overwhelmed by school work and gets anxious when he uses 
Adderall daily for school.  He stated that the Klonopin is 
useful when he feels anxious and it has been the only thing that 
helps his anxiety.  However, given history of substance and 
alcohol use and lack of other coping skills, the inpatient team 
tapered him off Klonipin and recommend not re-starting it as an 
outpatient.  Patient initially felt "clear headed" off the 
Klonopin, but by the end of the admission was stating he needed 
it for his anxiety.  Would consider a SSRI and relaxation/coping 
skills in place of benzodiazepines.   
 
3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) Marijuana abuse, counseled patient to avoid street drugs and 
alcohol as they will worsen his depression.  Patient stated that 
he only uses street drugs when he feels depressed and only 
drinks to be social with friends and does not think it 
interferes with his function.  

4. MEDICAL
#)Asthma: Continued home inhalers 

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patients primary team met with them daily and various 
psychotherapeutic modalities were utilized during those times. 

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
Patient initially did not want his parents involved as he felt 
they "take over" everything.  However, he did contact them and 
subsequently agreed to have a family meeting with them.  He did 
not want to discuss his substance use with his parents or for 
them to know what he had told the team about his recent use.  
Family meeting mostly focused on plan for where he would ___ upon 
discharge given that he was behind in school work and unsure if 
he could safely return and finish the semester but at the same 
time did not want to ___ home due to his relationship with his 
mother and that none of his friends would be around until 
___.  Upon discharge, agreed plan was for his father to talk 
to his ___ to see if he could return to complete a few of 
his courses and then return home for the summer.    

#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: Remeron 45 mg QHS, tried trazodone and vistaril 
for sleep which were not helpful per patient. 
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: Patient will return to ___ 
pending evaluation by school.  Has a psychiatrist in ___ 
and one in ___.  Currently has appointment with psychiatrist in

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself based on his reported 
depressed mood and recent research into over the counter 
medications that could be lethal.  Their static factors noted at 
that time include history of suicide attempts, history of 
substance abuse, male gender, Caucasian race, age, marital 
status, and the presence of a concurrent personality disorder.   
The modifiable risk factors included limited coping skills, few 
outpatient providers, insomnia, lack of purpose, impulsivity and 
active substance use.  The inpatient team discussed substance 
use with the patient and encouraged him to abstain from drugs 
and alcohol.  He is being referred to a partial program to work 
on coping skills.  Finally, the patient is being discharged with 
many protective risk factors including help-seeking nature, 
future-oriented viewpoint, strong family support, lack of 
suicidal ideation, no history of abuse, and strong social 
supports.  Overall, based on the totality of our assessment at 
this time, the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm nor danger to others. 

Our Prognosis of this patient is, fair as he has some insight 
into his condition and has good resources for further treatment. 
 However, he has had multiple admissions and on going substance 
use and poor coping which he will need to address in order to 
avoid re-admission in the future.
