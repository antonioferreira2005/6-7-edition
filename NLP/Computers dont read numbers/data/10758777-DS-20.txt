History of Present Illness:
___ with h/o transfusion dependent thalassemia, MDS, DM, and 
asthma who presents with flank pain.  Patient reports acute 
sever left flank pain that began 2 days ago accompanied by some 
dry heaves, no fever. At that time, she presented to ED where 
CTU demonstrated a tiny UVJ stone and UA notable for blood.  She 
was discharged home with vicodin, and plan for outpatient 
management. At home, she noted no improvement in her symptoms 
and when she presented to her regular appointment for blood 
transfusion yesterday, where she complained of worsening pain 
and was sent to the ED for evaluation. The patient also notes 
increased urinary frequency, mild dysuria and occasionally 
seeing blood in the urine. Also endorses some pain with flexion 
of her left leg. She has had no fevers, chills, diarrhea, 
constipation, bleeding, melena or other complaints.
.
In ED, initial VS were T96.7, BP172/56, HR 68, RR 18, O2 96%RA.  
Labs showed elevated cr to 1.6 from ___ yesteday (her previous 
normal baseline).  Her UA showed RBC's, no WBC's but cultures 
from the ___ were growing > 100K GNR's.  Ultrasound showed 
fullness of the left collecting system and a left UVJ stone that 
was more prominent on exam. The patient was seen by urology in 
the ED who felt that this was likely UTI w/ stone rather than 
stone with secondary infection and that stone was an unlikely 
cause for her renal failure. She was admitted to medicine for 
management and was given 6mg IV morphine, cipro 400mg IV, flomax 
0.4mg prior to admission.
.
Last VS prior to transfer were: T99, 64 159/47 16 99%RA, 1L in

Additional 
non-obstructing stones in the left kidney.

slightly increased when compared to prior exam. Non-obstructing 
left renal 
calculi, unchanged.

exams. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F w/ thalassemia, DM, p/w obstructing renal calculus and 
___.  
.  
#Acute Kidney Injury: 
Creatinine was elevated from baseline 1.0-1.1 to 1.6 at 
presentation. Patient appeared mildly volume depleted, but 
denies any decrease in PO intake or excess losses. She did 
receive IV contrast on ___ for CTU. Unilateral kidney stone in 
setting of otherwise normal renal function was considered 
unlikely to be causing ___. Urine lytes showed pre-renal 
picture, and patient received IVF bolus. UA showed blood, rbcs 
and wbcs. Most likely etiology ___ was IV contrast in setting 
of volume depletion from UTI and kidney stone. Creatinine 
improved to 1.2 at discharge. 
.
# Nephrolithiasis: Patient presented with flank and groin pain, 
blood in UA and UVJ stone described as "tiny" on CTU. Renal U/S 
showed interval development of right hydronephrosis. Patient was 
seen by urology in ED, recommended conservative treatmemt with 
Flomax and pain control. Patient Patient was treated with IV 
then PO morphine. UA revealed uric acid crystals, and serum uric 
acid was elevated at 8.2. Urine pH was low at 5.0. Patient was 
hydrated and given Bicitra to alkalinize urine. Urology 
recommended outpatient follow-up, and re-evaluation for 
cystoscopy if stone not passed by 2 weeks. Patient will continue 
Flomax and Bicitra at home. She will need repeat serum uric acid 
after this episode, to determine need for allopurinol. 
.
#. UTI/pyelonephritis:
Initial UA was indeterminate and Ucx was read in error as 
>100,000 organisms. Repeat UA showed blood, 26 rbc, 61 wbc and 
few bacteria. Urine cx was negative, however patient had already 
received antibiotics. She did have right-sided flank pain and 
dysuria. Considering she is at higher risk for infection and 
pyelo due to obstructing UVJ stone, she was continued on cipro. 
In addition, her initial leukocytosis improved after cipro. She 
will complete a 14 day course for presumed pyelo. 
.  
# Thalassemia/Anemia: Hct at baseline. Receives weekly 
transfusions. Should follow-up with Dr. ___: uric acid 
level.     
.  
# Diabetes: Oral hypoglycemics held during hospitalization. 
Glyburide-metformin restarted at discharge as renal function was 
improving. 
.  
# Hypertension: Held diovan/HCTZ until evaluated by PCP. 
Continued amlodipine and nebivalol. Normotensive during hospital 
course. 
.  
# Hypercholesterolemia: continued home medications.

Hypertension

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure participating in your care the the ___ 
___. You were admitted to the hospital 
with worsening pain attributed to a kidney stone on your left 
side as well as a possible infection of your kidneys. In the 
hospital, we performed an ultrasound to examine the stone and 
tested your blood to evaluate your kidney function. We also 
started you on antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) for your infection 
and also gave you some new medicines (tamulosin and Bicitra) to 
help you pass your kidney stone. We managed your pain with 
morphine. During your stay, your kidney function and pain 
steadily improved.

During your stay in the hospital - we decided to stop your 
Diovan-HCTZ because taking this medication makes it difficult to 
assess kidney function and may make you more prone to forming 
kidney stones. We are holding this medication at discharge as 
well. Please see your PCP about restarting this medication or if 
there are other options to control your blood pressure.
.
You may take Tylenol, Motrin or morphine pills for pain. You 
should continue to strain your urine and monitor for passing the 
stone.
.
Please return to the hospital if you have worsening back and 
flank pain, more blood in the urine, fevers, chills, 
nightsweats, nausea, vomiting or other concerning symptoms. 
Please follow up with Urology in the next week and schedule an 
appointment with your primary care provider within the next 2 
weeks. See below for follow-up instructions.
