Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
- HCC: History of hepatitis B and was found to have a right 
hepatic lobe tumor in ___, when he presented to his 
primary care physician while living in ___ at that time for a 
routine check up.  He was found to have abnormal liver function 
tests, which prompted a liver ultrasound, revealing the tumor. 
On ___, when he was seen in your clinic, he did have a CT 
scan of the torso, which confirmed the presence of a large 
ill-defined heterogeneous enhancing mass within the entire 
posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe with portal vein 
thrombosis with probable tumor thrombus within the portal vein.  
There was complete occlusion of the right portal vein, but the 
left portal vein was patent.  There was no evidence of any
metastatic disease at the time of that imaging study.  He 
therefore went for surgery on ___ and he had a right 
hepatic lobectomy with cholecystectomy and intraoperative 
ultrasound.  The  intraoperative ultrasound revealed no lesions 
in the left lobe of the liver. The pathology from that tumor 
resection revealed hepatocellular carcinoma within the mass of 
the right lobe of the liver.  The tumor was 11 cm in greatest 
dimension.  There were numerous smaller nodules besides the 
dominant mass.  The primary tumor was deemed to be a T3 lesion.  
There were two lymph nodes examined and they were uninvolved by 
tumor.  The margins were uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.  
There was, however, extensive large
vessel invasion present.

RADIOLOGY PROCEDURE REPORT on ___:
FINDINGS:
1. SMA arteriography demonstrates a patent portal vein.
2. Aside from expected findings after right hepatic lobectomy, 
there is
conventional arterial anatomy, with the common and left hepatic 
artery arising
from the celiac axis.
3. Celiac angiography demonstrates six to seven focal 
hyper-enhancing nodules
within segments II/III. There is a smaller arterial enhancing 
nodule within
segment ___.
4. Markedly tortuous anatomy of the target branch feeding 
segments II/III,
which encompasses the majority of the arterial enhancing nodules 
seen.
 
IMPRESSION: Unsuccessful subselective chemoembolization of the 
dominant
tertiary left hepatic artery branch supplying ___ arterial 
enhancing tumor
nodules within Segments II/III due to difficult arterial 
anatomy. The patient
will return in 1 week for a repeat procedure. 

CXRAY ON ___:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a 
substantial
improvement with complete resolution of the pre-existing right 
pleural
effusion. The transparency of the lung parenchyma is 
unremarkable, no
evidence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia, no 
pulmonary
nodules. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette, mild tortuosity 
of the
thoracic aorta.
