Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
s/p arrest
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none
 
History of Present Illness:
___ y.o F with mild dementia, CAD, DM on insulin, and HTN, who 
initially presented to ___ for lethargy and hypoxia and 
was found to have and RSV infection and who is now s/p cardiac 
arrest this AM with suggestion of cardiac etiology. 

Patient is a poor historian at baseline and is intubated on 
arrival History obtained from chart. Patient presented to 
___ with cough and lethargy and was noted to be hypoxic. 
She tested positive for RSV and was admitted for symptomatic 
treatment with supplemental O2 and nebs. A CXR was notably 
negative on admission for PNA or signs of volume overload. This 
morning at 8 AM immediately after phlebotomy she was noted to be 
unresponsive, cyanotic and pulseless and so a code blue was 
called. Rhythm was reportedly PEA (no strips sent with patient).

CPR, 3 rounds of epinephrine, 2 amps of bicarb. She had an 
emergent left femoral groin line placed. ROSC was achieved and 
she was transferred to ICU.

III, AVF, V3-V6 and 1mm STE in AVL, sub MM STE in AVR

Labs post arrest were notable for: 
Chemistries: K of 3.9, Bicarb of 21 GLU 557 Cr 1.6 from 1.1 on 
admission

and CKMB of 10.4 (CK 1374). 
Arterial gas: 7.22/42/359
Lactate: 8.3
 
BNP on admission was ___

Echocardiogram showed distal septal, apical, anterior akinesis.  
Global ejection fraction 35%.  Mild mitral, tricuspid, and 
aortic insufficiency. She was started on aspirin, plavix and 
heparin gtt for MI management. She was started on norepinephrine 
and phenylephrine for hypotension. She was given vancomycin and 
zosyn. She was given 2L of NS. She was also given 40mg of

in ___ and stents in RCA and LAD in ___ (per 
chart review).

IMAGING
--------
___ TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate 
to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the septum, anterior wall, 
distal inferior wall and apex. The remaining segments contract 
normally. Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 31 %. The estimated 
cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). Doppler 
parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic 
function. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with 
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to 
moderate (___) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an 
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 


IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe regional left ventricular 
dysfunction c/w CAD (LAD distribution). Mildly dilated right 
ventricle with mild free wall hypokinesis. Mild to moderate 
aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation.  

___ CXR: ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carinal.  NG tube tip 
is in the stomach.  Heart size and mediastinum are overall 
unremarkable.  Interstitial opacities left more than right are 
concerning with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Some all via 
lower component might be there as well.  There is no 
pneumothorax. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o F with mild dementia, CAD, DM on insulin, and HTN, who 
initially presented to ___ for lethargy and hypoxia and 
was found to have and RSV infection and who is now s/p cardiac 
arrest this AM with suggestion of cardiac etiology. Patient is a 
poor historian at baseline and was intubated on arrival. History 
obtained from chart. Patient presented to ___ with cough 
and lethargy and was noted to be hypoxic. She tested positive 
for RSV and was admitted for symptomatic treatment with 
supplemental O2 and nebs. A CXR was notably negative on 
admission for PNA or signs of volume overload. The following 
morning, immediately after phlebotomy she was noted to be 
unresponsive, cyanotic and pulseless and so a code blue was 
called. Rhythm was reportedly PEA (no strips sent with patient). 
She was intubated in this setting. She underwent 5 rounds of 
CPR, 3 rounds of epinephrine, 2 amps of bicarb. She had an 
emergent left femoral groin line placed. ROSC was achieved and 
she was transferred to ICU for further management. She was 
initially started on post-arrest protocol but after discussions 
with her family, decision to transition care to CMO was made. 
Patient subsequently passed away.
