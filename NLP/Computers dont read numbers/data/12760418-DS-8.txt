On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout his admission. However, he was not able to understand 
the terms of this agreement and was therefore admitted on a 
___, which expired on ___.  At that time, after

throughout his admission. He filed a request for discharge on 
___ and declined to stay past the three day evaluation 
period. He was also placed on 15 minute checks status on 
admission and remained on that level of observation throughout 
while being unit restricted.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#1) Schizophrenia: Admitted for disorganized thinking and 
behavior and poor self care. Throughout his admission, he had no 
positive symptoms of hallucinations or delusions and mood was 
euthymic. He remained calm and pleasant but isolated, speaking 
to staff politely when requested and participating in a home 
safety evaluation, but declining all participation in groups and 
interacting minimally with other residents.

On admission, his home Risperdal was increased to 3 mg BID from 
3 mg daily. He remained compliant with his medications 
throughout his hospitalization. He was evaluated by occupational 
therapy and demonstrated some safety awareness, although his 
assessment was limited by reportedly not having his glasses. He 
was able to describe how he would tidy his home and go to a 
dental clinic on discharge. His thinking became more organized 
during the hospitalization, although he was not proactive in his 
personal hygiene.

Given his difficulty with medication compliance prior to 
admission, he was started on long-acting Risperdal and his oral 
regiment was consolidated from risperidone 3 mg BID to 6 mg 
daily. He will follow up with his psychiatrist and primary care 
provider, who are aware of his admission and course.
