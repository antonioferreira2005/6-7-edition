CXR ___:
Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and accompanied by new 
distention of the azygos vein and pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Mild 
interstitial edema is present.  Patchy and linear opacities at 
the bases 
probably represent atelectasis, and note is made of small 
bilateral pleural effusions. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Colorectal surgery service on 
___ for elective laparoscopic LAR for a preliminary T2NO 
rectal mass. The patient tolerated the procedure well. 

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received a morphine PCA 
with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral 
intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. 

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored. 

Pulmonary: The patient was noted to have an increased oxygen 
requirement on POD#1, with CXR demonstrating mild interstitial 
edema. She was not tachycardic and did not raise sufficient 
clinical suspicion to warrant CTA to rule-out PE. She was given 
lasix 10 IV once and diuresed throughout the day. She has a 
history of smoking and was started on nebulizer treatments, 
encouraged incentive spirometry use, with subsequent decrease in 
O2 requirement. She required no additional oxygen prior to 
discharge with normal ambulatory oxygen saturations prior to 
discharge.

GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until 
tolerating oral intake. Her diet was advanced when appropriate, 
which was tolerated well. She had passage of flatus and a bowel 
movement prior to discharge. Her foley was removed on POD#2, and 
she was able to void successfully. Intake and output were 
closely monitored. 

ID: The patient received pre-operative cefazolin and flagyl. The 
patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of 
infection. 

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during 
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as 
possible. 

At the time of discharge on POD#4, the patient was doing well, 
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a Low Anterior Resection 
for surgical management of your rectal cancer. You have 
recovered from this procedure well and you are now ready to 
return home. Samples from your colon were taken and this tissue 
has been sent to the pathology department for analysis. You will 
receive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment. 
If there is an urgent need for the surgeon to contact you 
regarding these results they will contact you before this time. 
You have tolerated a regular diet, are passing gas and your pain 
is controlled with pain medications by mouth. You may return 
home to finish your recovery.

that you have a bowel movement in the next ___ days. After 
anesthesia it is not uncommon for patientÂ’s to have some 
decrease in bowel function but you should not have prolonged 
constipation. Some loose stool and passing of small amounts of 
dark, old appearing blood are expected. However, if you notice 
that you are passing bright red blood with bowel movements or 
having loose stool without improvement please call the office or

taking narcotic pain medications there is a risk that you will 
have some constipation. Please take an over the counter stool

severe: increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal 
pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, 
prolonged loose stool, or extended constipation.

which are closed with internal sutures and a skin glue called 
Dermabond. These are healing well however it is important that 
you monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness of the incision lines, 
white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, increased pain at the 
incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or 
swelling of the area. Please call the office if you develop any 
of these symptoms or a fever. You may go to the emergency room 
if your symptoms are severe. 

You may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. 
The small incisions may be left open to the air. If closed with 
steri-strips (little white adhesive strips) instead of 
Dermabond, these will fall off over time, please do not remove 
them. Please no baths or swimming for 6 weeks after surgery 
unless told otherwise by Dr. ___ Dr. ___.
