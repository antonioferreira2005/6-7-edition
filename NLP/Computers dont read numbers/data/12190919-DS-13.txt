IMAGING:

1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease and more advanced liver disease including 
steatohepatitis or significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot 
be excluded on this study. 
2. No suspicious focal liver lesions detected. 
3. The gallbladder is collapsed without evidence of stones. 
4. A 3.4 cm cystic lesion is seen along the spleen. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ little adult routine care before ___ and with PMHx 
significant for COPD, EtOH abuse (states last drink 2 weeks 
ago), CKD III, PVD, presenting from routine PCP visit with 
abnormal labs sig for Cr 2.4 (baseline 1.2) and lipase of 435 
(was 41 on ___. The patient had recent history of abdominal 
pain and resultant decreased oral intake over the week prior to 
admission per collateral from his daughter. ___ were stable 
through ED and hospital course with downtrending lipase and LFTs 
on repeated check in ED and on medical floor. The patient 
remained asymptomatic through hospital course and expressed 
hunger. He tolerated oral intake well and was discharged to 
outpatient follow-up with primary care provider.

# Elevated lipase: Patient has asymptomatic elevated lipase and 
nontender abdomen, even to deep palpation. Does not meet 
criteria for clinical pancreatitis during admission, but 
possible that patient had clinical pancreatitis that may have 
resolved. Other explanations include renal impairment with less 
excretion of lipase, neoplastic causes, or possible cystic 
lesion causing obstructive process. Also, studies have shown 
that patients with alcohol abuse can have elevated lipase levels 
of 3 or more x the ULN and be asymptomatic. Given IVF and NPO 
overnight and advanced on HD#1.  

#Acute on chronic CKD: Presented with resolving ___ from 2.4 as 
outpatient to 1.9 on admission and 1.7 on day of discharge. 
Likely secondary to dehydration from poor nutrition in setting 
of alcohol abuse, received IVF overnight.

#COPD/Emphysema: Pt had worsening PFTs at last pulmonary visit, 
and Advair was added to his regimen. Currently does not complain 
of SOB.  
 - Continued tiotroprium 18 mcg daily (Spiriva)  
 - Continued Advair 100/50 1 puff BID  
 - Cont Albuterol PRN for SOB  
 
#Weight loss: Unclear etiology. Low suspicion of pulmonary 
cachexia as overall work of breathing appears mild even though 
by spirometry, COPD severe. ___ be malnutrition in setting of 
alcohol abuse. Patient does have risk factors for malignancy 
including smoking (has LUL nodule being followed) and alcohol 
abuse. Elevated lipase could represent obstruction from 
pancreatic neoplasm.  
 - Consider further abdominal imaging ___ resolves to 
investigate for reason for lipase elevation as outpatient

#Alcohol abuse: Last reported drink reportedly was 2 weeks 
prior. At previous hospitalization and with PCP has refused to 
engage in EtOH cessation discussions. Left AMA at previous 
hospitalization before SW could speak with him. Counseled 
patient on alcohol cessation and risk for further injury and 
death if continued.
 - continued MVI, folate, thiamine  
 - continued discussion regarding cessation and resources as 
outpatient

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Counseled on alcohol cessation, please continue discussion and 
resources provided as an outpatient
-Creatinine 1.7 on day of discharge, please repeat as outpatient
-Please repeat LFTs as outpatient

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted with concern for your recent abnormal 
laboratory values in the setting of your abdominal pain. Your 
lab tests improved during admission with imaging that was 
reassuring. You were observed overnight and were able to eat 
without issue. It is likely your drinking resulted in the 
elevated liver tests and may have contributed to your decreased 
ability to eat. It is important for you to stop drinking alcohol 
to prevent further damage to this area. Please follow-up with 
your primary care provider ___ ___ weeks to be evaluated and have 
labwork performed.

Wishing you the best of health,
Your ___ team
