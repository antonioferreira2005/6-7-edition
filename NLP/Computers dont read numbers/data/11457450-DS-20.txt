History of Present Illness:
 Mr ___ is a ___ year old man with a PMH significant for 
dCHF (LVEF 60%), CAD s/p MI, and COPD who is transferred for 
management of shortness of breath.  
 Mr ___ was in his USOH until 2 days prior when he developed 
shortness of breath acutely. He had ongoing shortness of breath, 
unchanged before he decided to go to the hospital. Prior to 
this, he had no leg swelling, orthopnea or PND. Never had chest 
pain during any episodes. He presented to an outpatient office 
where he was observed to be dyspneic and he was tachy by EKG. He 
was referred in to the BI-M ED.  
 There, his oxygenation was 89 - 91%, he was tachypneic, a 
D-dimer was  
 negative and an NTBNP was 1200 (baseline BNP 250 which equals  
 about 1000 in NTBNP). INR was 7.1 and was given vitamin K. 
Trops there negative.  
 
 Per patient, his dry weight is 230lb and his weight has not 
significantly changed in the past week. His ___ edema is minor, 
he says his legs are "skinny."

STUDIES:
___ EKG:
Supraventricular tachycardia with extensive artifact. Probable 
atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction. No previous tracing 
available for comparison. 

___ TEE:
Conclusions   
 No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of 
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right 
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen 
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). There are simple 
atheroma in the aortic arch and the descending thoracic aorta. 
The right ventricle has depressed free wall contractility. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the 
aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen 
on the mitral valve. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: No thrombi or spontaneous echo contrast in the 
atria or atrial appendages. Depressed biventricular systolic 
function. No significant valvular disease
 

___ Chest CT w/o contrast:
IMPRESSION:  
Pre-existing pulmonary emphysema and pulmonary nodules are 
stable.  No 
lymphadenopathy.  No pleural effusions.  No evidence of acute 
lung 

___ EKG
Sinus rhythm. Non-specific repolarization abnormalities. Cannot 
exclude 
inferior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. Compared to 
the previous tracing of ___ there is no diagnostic change. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ is a ___ year old man with a PMH significant for 
___, CAD s/p MI, atrial tachycardia, and COPD who is 
transferred for management of shortness of breath. 

#) Atrial tachycardia: Mr. ___ presented with dyspnea despite 
being at his dry weight and with no sings of volume overload on 
exam. CT chest showed stable pre-existing pulmonary emphysema 
and pulmonary nodules, with no acute lung process. His dyspnea 
was thought to be due to worsening of baseline lung disease with 
superimposed atrial tachycardia. TEE showed no atrial thrombi, 
depressed biventricular systolic function (EF 40%), no 
significant valvular disease. He received cardioversion of 
atrial tachycardia and remained in sinus rhythm thereafter, and 
comfortable on room air. Cardiac biomarkers unremarkable. 

#)Coagulopathy: Pt initially presented with supratherapeutic 
INR. This was thought to be ___ poor nutrition (pt reports not 
eating very much) and not taking his medicatins appropriately 
(pt reports taking his Coumadin BID). He had already received 
vitamin K prior to transfer. Warfarin was resumed at discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES  
 # HTN: Was normotensive on home meds, Please consider starting 
ACE if elevated
 # COPD: No signs of active exacerbation while admitted, 
continued home inhalers   
 # Chronic Pain Syndrome: Continued home methadone and dilaudid  

 # Tobacco Dependence: Nicotine patch  
 # Insomnia: continued home diazepam PRN  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
--------------------
- He will need continued close monitoring of INR in setting of 
poor understanding of medication regimen and supratherapeutic 
INR.
- Torsemide dose was adjusted to 10mg daily and may need further 
adjustment following discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure being part of your care at ___. You were 
admitted to the hospital due to shortness of breath. You were 
found to be in an abnormal heart rhythm. You had an ablation 
procedure which successfully restored your heart to a normal 
rhythm. You also had a lung scan which showed chronic lung 
disease. 

After discharge, please follow up with your doctors as described 
below.

We wish you the best.
Your ___ care team
