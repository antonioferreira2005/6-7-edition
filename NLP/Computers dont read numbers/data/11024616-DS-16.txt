Brief Hospital Course:
PSYCHIATRIC
#)On admission, patient was dysphoric but open and cooperative 
with treatment.  She described a relief from her suicidal 
feelings given the containment of the unit but continued to feel 
anxious and depressed.  A thoughtful discussion of alternative 
medication options were reviewed given her failure of 3 SSRIs. 
Between Wellbutrin and Remeron patient prefered Remeron for it's 
sedation effects and appetite stimulation as difficulty sleeping 
and eating were two of her primary concerns.  Patient was 
started on remeron 7.5mg qHS which she tolerated well and had 
desired effect of increased sleep.  
On discharge, mood was improved, MSE was pertinent for brigth 
affect, future orientation, and denial of SI.

throughout this hospitalization and did not require physical or 
chemical restraint. The patient remained on 15 minute checks,

admission.

RISK ASSESSMENT:
This patient does not abuse substances although has misused them 
at times, is currently not suicidal, is feeling well and is 
animated, euthymic, and participatory in the milieu, all of 
which indicate a low immediate risk of harm.

Static risk factors include:
-history of depression, history of trauma/abuse, family history 
of mental illness. 
Modifiable risk factors include:
-hopelessness, active etoh misuse, acute major mood episode, 
active SI. We modified this risk by transition to Remeron and 
providing resources for sexual assault counseling. 
Protective factors include:
-Protective factors include current outpatient 
providers/treatment, strong connections to friend support, and 
skills in problem solving, conflict resolution and handling 
problems in a non-violent way. Current risk is low for 
intentional self-harm given that pt denies suicidal ideation, 
intent and plan, is accepting of treatment, is currently sober 
and is future oriented.

and possible side effects and risks of Remeron, and risks and
