History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old woman with a history of hypertension and 
hyperlipidemia who presents with anterior STEMI.  She saw her 
PCP ___ ___ with ten days of back pain between her scapula 
and it was felt she had a radiculopathy.  She then presented to 
___ ED on ___ for worsening back pain, shoulder and 
neck pain associated with vomiting.  EKG performed at that time 
showed ST elevations in leads I, avL, V2-V5. She was not cathed 
at that time as symptoms had been present for 10 days and were 
improving. CPK 1670, MB 99.2, RI 8.1, Trop 3.24.  She was cathed 
at the outside hospital on day of admission to ___ and found 
to have subtotally occluded LAD.  She was then transferred here 
for PCI. Sheath in RFA, pulses dopplerable.  She was given 600mg 
of plavix and aspirin 325mg on morning of admission along with 
20mg lasix for LVEDP of 35 mmHG. Echo revealed an LVEF of 
___. Upon transfer to ___, she underwent cardiac 
catheterization with PCI of LAD.  She was started on 
integrillin.  Upon transfer to the CCU, she continued to endorse 
back pain however she feels it considerably improved.  
.
Prior to this event, she has never had any overt anginal 
symptoms.  Her exercise tolerance is good, with no shortness of 
breath or anginal equivalents with exercise.  She used to swim 
frequently however in the past several months, following her 
husband's death in ___, she has stopped exercising.  
Cardiac risk factors include hypertension and hyperlipidemia, 
and she has been on atenolol and simvastatin for these issues 
respectively.  She has never had any prior MIs, known coronary 
disease, stress tests, or cardiac catheterization.  
.
Review of systems is negative for chest pressure/pain, shortness 
of breath, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, blurry 
vision, dysuria, fevers, chills.

___ EKG:

rhythm with 
somewhat atypical P wave. Marked left axis deviation. 
Intraventricular 
conduction delay of right bundle-branch block type with Q waves 
in leads V1-V2 with J point and ST segment elevation in leads I, 
aVL and V2-V6. Probable extensive anterior wall myocardial

.
___ Catherization:
COMMENTS:      
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed patent LMCA, 100% 
proximal 
occlusion of the LAD with faint left to left collaterals, patent 
LCX. 
2. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided filling 
pressures were elevated (mean RA pressure was 15mmHg and RVEDP 
was 
23mmHg). The pulmonary artery pressure was elevated measuring 
45/23mmHg. 
The left sided filling pressures were elevated (mean PCW 
pressure was 
34mmHg). The systemic arterial pressure was normal measuring 
109/69mmHg. 
The cardiac index was measured 2.0L/min/m2 using an assumed 
oxygen 
consumption index. 
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the LAD with a 2.5x28mm 
Promus stent 
that was postdilated to 2.75mm. Final angiography revealed no 
residual 
stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III 
flow (see 
___ comments). 
4. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. One vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures. 
3. Borderline low cardiac index. 
4. Successful PCI of the LAD. 
5. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device. 
.

___ Carotid U/S:
Impression: Right ICA stenosis 0. 
Left ICA stenosis 0. 
.
___ Abdominal U/S:
Right pleural effusion and trace free fluid in ___'s pouch.  

Otherwise, unremarkable abdominal sonogram.  
.
___ Cardiac MRI: Report pending
Impression: 
1. Ischemic cardiomyopathy with mildly increased left 
ventricular cavity size, extensive akinesis/dyskinesis involving 
the proximal LAD territory and severely depressed global 
systolic function (LVEF 28%). Late gadolinium contrast-enhanced 
CMR images demonstrated transmural areas of fibrosis in the 
apex, anterior wall, mid-distal septum, and distal inferolateral 
walls. Low dose dobutamine images showed no improvement of these 
segments consistent with poor likelihood of functional recovery 
after mechanical revascularization. 2. Normal right ventricular 
cavity size with apical akinesis. The RVEF was moderately 
depressed at 30%. 
3. Mild aortic regurgitation. 4. The indexed diameters of the 
ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal. The main 
pulmonary artery diameter index was normal. 5. Mild left atrial 
enlargement. 
.
___ CXR:
FINDINGS: Moderate cardiomegaly, minimal overhydration, mainly 
manifested by an increase in diameter of the perihilar vessels. 
In addition, small 
bilateral pleural effusions are visible on the lateral 
radiograph. 
No evidence of focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. 
No lung 
nodules or masses. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. 
.
___ Cath:
COMMENTS:

proximal 
occlusion of the LAD with faint left to left collaterals, patent 
LCX. 
2. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided filling 
pressures were elevated (mean RA pressure was 15mmHg and RVEDP

Promus stent 
that was postdilated to 2.75mm. Final angiography revealed no

stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III 
flow (see 
PTCA comments). 
4. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. One vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures. 
3. Borderline low cardiac index. 
4. Successful PCI of the LAD. 
5. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with history of hyperlipidemia and 
hypertension presenting with anterior MI with ST elevations in 
lateral leads s/p PCI to LAD with cardiomyopathy noted on echo 
with EF of 10%. 
.
# Coronary Artery Disease:  Cardiac risk factors include 
hyperlipidemia and hypertension.  Single vessel disease, with 
anterior MI likely secondary to plaque rupture in LAD.  
Concomittant cardiomyopathy is likely ischemic secondary to LAD 
lesion. Patient was discharged on aspirin 325mg, lipitor 80mg, 
plavix 75mg, and lisinopril. Patient was not on beta-blocker ___ 
bradycardia. 
.
# Cardiomyopathy - Likely ischemic cardiomyopathy given 
concomittant LAD lesion.  Lovenox bridge to warfarin was started 
due to risk of LV aneurysmal dilation. MRI was done to determie 
extent of scar formation. Transplant work up was started but 
will need to be followed up by outpatient cardiologist. As part 
of work up patient will need outpatient PFT
.
# Hypertension - Continue lisinopril 
.
# Hyperlipidemia - Continue atorvastatin
