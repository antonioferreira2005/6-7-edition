LENIs:
IMPRESSION: No DVT in left lower extremity.
.
.
CT of head:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, 
shift of 
normally midline structures or hydrocephalus. Again seen is a 
stable area of 
low attenuation in the right parietal lobe, consistent with 
encephalomalacia from prior infarct. Linear areas of 
hypoattenuation are 
noted at the left vertex, also present on the prior study. 
  
There is no hydrocephalus. The ventricles and extra-axial sulci 
are 
prominent, consistent with age-related involution. 
  
The imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are aerated. 
  
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or edema 
.
.
CXR:
FINDINGS: 
The left costophrenic angle as well as the left-sided lower ribs 
have not been 
included at this examination. Within these limitations, there is 
a right- 
sided central line with the tip projected over the right atrium. 
There is 
stable cardiomegaly. There are no focal consolidations. There is 
 
increased interstitial edema since the prior study. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M with hx of DM, ESRD on HD, CHF and afib presents to the 
ER with altered mental status per report of his neighbor in the 
___ apartment complex.  
.
He received a 500 cc bolus in the ED for SBPs in the ___ and 
some D50 in the field for finger stick of 69.  Pt was feeling 
much better upon arrival to the ED and did not think that he 
needed to be admitted.  Was very upset with his neighbor, but 
was cooperative.
.
His mental status improved over the course of the day.  When he 
was first seen by neurology in ___ ED, he was very somnulent and 
it was difficult to get an appropriate exam because of his 
continued falling asleep.  By afternoon, he was completely alert 
and oriented and appropriate.  His neurological deficits were 
only a mild bilateral tremor which he says is chronic.  No 
weakness, was able to ambulate will with his walker.
.
The likely cause of his altered mental status was drug effect.  
He takes a large amount of gabapentin every day and he knows the 
risk of the high dose with his decreased renal clearance.  He 
rather live with the risks because it takes his pain away.  He 
is trying to transition to topamax with Dr. ___.  It was 
started at his last clinic visit.  We are not going to switch 
any of his medicines at this time.  His low blood sugar may have 
contributed, as well, so we decreased his nighttime dose of 
insulin from 14 units to 10 units.  Other causes may have been 
infection, although he has been afebrile and did not have a 
leukocytosis.  He had a slightly positive UA, but is 
asymptomatic and did not feel that it was worth treating.  He 
also has a weeping LLE wound that he has been picking at over 
the last few weeks.  It is red, but no pus drainage.  It is not 
bothering him.  He did refuse a dose of vanco in the emergency 
room and dose not want treatment.
.
Renal was also consulted today because he was due for dialysis.  
He received dialysis while an inpatient.
.
For this patient, quality of life is the most important goal.  
He likes to have control and was very unhappy while an 
inpatient.  He was discharged home after dialysis with follow up 
in Dr. ___ in ___.  He will continue dialysis 
at his usual place on ___ schedule.  He will also 
continue to take his herbal medicines despite the warnings from 
his PCP and renal doctors.
