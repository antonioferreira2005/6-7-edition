Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old female with a history of sick 
sinus syndrome(s/p PPM) and Afib s/p PVI last year and redo on 
___ who presented with 3 days of shortness of breath at rest, 
dry cough, and fever. On admission there were signs that 
suggested pneumonia (diminished sounds in right lung lower lobe) 
and pulmonary infiltrates on the right lower lobe. The patient 
also complained of sudden weight gain, and her physical exam was 
significant for the presence of bilateral crackles on 
auscultation of the lungs and lower extremity edema. Lab studies 
revealed a cardiac enzyme leakage, normocytic normochromic 
anemia, and hyperbilurrubinemia. 

ACTIVE ISSUES: 

COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: One of the patient's complaints 
was dry cough associated to an episode of fever and chills. The 
chest X ray revealed pulmonary infiltrates on her right lower 
lobe. Treatment was started on treatment for community acquired 
pneumonia with ceftriaxone and doxycycline due to azithromycin's 
Qtc prolonging effect. The patient's symptoms improved after 
starting antibiotic therapy, oxygen supplementation was able to 
be weaned, vital signs were stable, and the patient's general 
appearance remained well. Transitioned to cefpodoxime prior to 
discharge for total of 10 day course (___) with 
doxycycline for 5 day course (___). 

VOLUME OVERLOAD: A major physical exam finding the patient had 
was lower extrimity edema and bilateral crackles heard on 
auscultation of the lungs, associated to the fact that the 
patient noted an acute (in 3 days) weight gain of 6 lbs since 
prior discharge. Volume overload was felt to be due to recent 
PVI and patient was diuresed with IV lasix and transitioned to 
PO lasix for 4 days at discharge. Spironolactone was added on 
day of discharge for 4 day course to prevent hypokalemia. Will 
need repeat labs on ___ to ensure stable creatinine and 
electrolytes. 

E COLI IN URINE: Patient with Ecoli and strep (B hemolytic) 
50-100K/field on urine culture from ___ on ___. Patient 
asymptomatic however with fever, could also consider this as 
source for her fever and symptoms. Is on Ceftriaxone and 
transitioning to cefpodoxime as above for pneumonia which should 
also cover these organisms. Will need follow-up of Ecoli

ANEMIA: Patient previously with hematocrit in the high ___ in 
the recent past including periprocedurally. She had a hct of 29 
on admission to ___ which decreased mildly to 27.9 prior 
to discharge. Unclear etiology however without evidence of 
bleeding. Haptoglobin and LDH normal. Tbili mildly elevated on 
admission, normalized to 1.4 prior to discharge. Iron studies 
with low iron and patient started on iron supplementation to be 
started after finishing doxycycline as outpatient. Will need 
repeat CBC and further workup as outpatient. 

HYPERBILURIBINEMIA: Indirect hyperbilirrubinemia was found in 
this hospitalization. Hemolytic anemia was taken into 
consideration but LDH and haptoglobin are normal. Also total 
bilirrubin downtrended in a 24 hour follow up. No future studies 
are needed for this finding. 

Atrial Fibrillation: Seen on EKG on admission. Noted to be AV 
paced. She was continued on dofetilide for antiarrhythmic 
effect. Patient also continued on dabigatran, nadalol and 
aspirin per prior medications. 

Hypertension: Valsartan held on admission due to infection, 
restarted at discharge. 

Transitional Issues:
======================
-Please have repeat chemistries and CBC drawn on ___ with 
results faxed to her PCP ___ ___
-Patient to continue lasix and spironolactone for 4 days 
(___)
-Continue cefpodoxime and doxycycline for total of 5 day course

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with new fever, cough and

pneumonia which we are treating with antibiotics. You will need 
to continue antibiotics for a total of 8 days (Doxycycline from 
___ and the cefpodoxime through ___. 

You were also found to have volume overload (increased fluid in 
your lungs and legs) which is likely related to your recent 
cardiac procedure (PVI). Your symptoms improved with a diuretic 
called furosemide (lasix). You should continue to take 
furosemide and spironolactone (Aldactone) for a total of 5 days. 
It is important that you have your labs checked on ___ to 
ensure that your electrolytes and kidney function are normal 
while taking these medications.

Please continue to take all of your medications as prescribed 
and follow-up with Dr. ___ your primary care physician
