History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of traumatic

psychogenic
nonepileptic seizures, who has now had very frequent episodes
___ per week), often unwitnessed, involving falling and
prolonged shaking at her group home recently, with resultant
visits to the Emergency Department (roughly 60 visits to the
___ in the past year). On a previous admission to the 
ED,
the patient had to be transferred to the ICU for breathing
difficulties on Ativan. She continues on five total 
antiepileptic
drugs including gabapentin, levetiracetam, lamotrigine,
zonisamide and the recently added clobazam, but the events
continue.

Sz: There are 2 seizure types: First one is described per OMR
that were discussed and affirmed by her sister and group home
nurse and the second per sister. 

1. Infrequently, the patient get a warning that a seizure is
about to occur when she sees stars. She is told by others that
she then collapses, and has convulsive shaking for up to 15
minutes in duration. She can only recall being in her group home
one minute then being in the hospital. Her events have been
associated with a number of injuries. She describes instances
where she has fallen off of the toilet and off of the bed at
night. Because of her risk of injury, Ms. ___ wears a 
helmet.
Her triggers include tiredness and flashing lights (though 
lights
only provoked an event one time in the past). She is told that
after her seizures that her speech is grabbled. 

2. Her sister noted that ___ years ago she had staring spells 
but
no automatisms. This has not been described as a recent seizure. 


One electrographric epileptic seizure captured in ___ 
apparently
left frontocentral in onset, lasting for about 30 seconds,
without definite clinical correlate. Some past EEG studies have
demonstrated left temporal slowing.

of vertigo. She endorses numbness and paralysis in the left
lateral cervical region. She endorses numbness in the L index
finger and thumb. She endorses constipation, stress incontinence

___ EEG
This is a normal continuous video EEG monitoring study. There 
are no pushbutton activations, focal abnormalities, epileptiform 
discharges, or electrographic seizures. 

___ EEG
This is a mildly abnormal continuous video EEG monitoring study 
due to frequent interruptions of focal slowing independently in 
both temporal 
regions, more often on the left, indicative of mild subcortical 
dysfunction in these regions. There are no pushbutton 
activations, epileptiform discharges, or electrographic 
seizures. 

___ EEG
This continuous video EEG recording was abnormal due to some 
intermittent focal slowing in the left temporal region 
suggesting focal subcortical dysfunction in that area. A 
pushbutton activation for head, ear, and finger symptoms was not 
associated with any significant EEG change. No 
epileptiform features or electrographic seizures were seen. The 
ackground 
showed a normal alpha rhythm during wakefulness.

___ EEG
This continuous video EEG recording captured no pushbutton 
activations, epileptiform features, or electrographic seizures. 
The 
background showed a normal alpha rhythm during wakefulness. 

___ EEG
This is a normal-appearing prolonged continuous EEG telemetry 
monitoring. There are periods of bitemporal independent theta 
slowing 
compatible with a psychomotor variant. Otherwise no focal, 
lateralizing, or epileptic features are clearly identified. 

___ EEG
This is a normal continuous EMU recording. There were several 
pushbuttons around one constellation of symptoms and behavior. 
Data as noted above. There is no change noted on EEG with it. 
The patient continues to have what appears to be bitemporal 
independent psychomotor variant. No clear interictal epileptic 
activity was identified on this tracing. 

___ EEG
This is a normal continuous EMU monitoring study. There are no 
pushbutton activations. No electrographic seizures are recorded. 


___ EEG
This is a normal continuous EMU recording. There was one 
pushbutton as noted above that did not have any clear 
electrographic or 
cardiac changes. It should be noted that the patient had very 
poor sleep 
during the course of this evening. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ was admitted to the hospital because of episodes 
concerning for seizures. She was monitored on EEG throughout her 
stay. We were able to wean her off of her levetiracetam, 
clobazam, and partly off of her gabapentin. We also changed her 
zonisamide to be twice a day. She did not have any episodes 
concerning for seizure, and her EEG did not demonstrate any 
epileptiform abnormalities or seizures. We felt that these falls 
were more likely related to her multiple medications making her 
unsteady than seizures.

***Transitional issues:
- Ca was 11.1 during admission. Medications that might increase 
Ca were stopped. Ca should be rechecked by PCP as outpatient, 
and Ca/VitD can be restarted as appropriate.
- if insomnia continues to be a problem, can consider starting 
trazodone
