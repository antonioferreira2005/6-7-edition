view. 

V/Q Scan ___
IMPRESSION:  Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.

KUB ___
Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.
The enteric tube tip terminates just distal to the 
gastroesophageal junction
and should be advanced if it has to be used for feeding 
purposes.

CXR ___
Lungs are low volume with bibasilar atelectasis.  NG tube 
projects below the left hemidiaphragm.  Cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is stable.  There are small bilateral effusions.  No

no evidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/ color Doppler. 
The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity 
size. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral

================================== 

# Right hip Fracture. Patient suffered mechanical fall with 
initial XR hip showing acute mildly displaced obliquely oriented 
intertrochanteric fracture of the right femur with slight valgus 
angulation and lateral displacement of distal fracture fragment. 
He underwent right hip ORIF on ___ after management of NSTEMI, 
Hypertension and tachycardia as below. Cardiology was consulted 
for NSTEMI and recommended holding plavix in ___ 
setting as had been more than ___ year since last cardiac event 
and indication was secondary prevention in a patient with ASA 
intolerance. Plavix was resumed. To complete 30 days of DVT 
prophylaxis. 14 day Xrays showing well-positioned hardware. 
Staples were removed. Discharged with follow up with 
orthopedics.

# NSTEMI, Type II. Patient had ECGs obtained in setting of 
nausea and dyspepsia overnight on ___, with one EKG on ___ 
at ___levation in the inferior leads in 
setting of prior infarcts
with repeat ECG at 450 1:18 AM showing resolution of those ECG 
changes. Trops and MB rose in setting of nausea, vomiting and 
elevated BPs/rates with peak MB of 36 and peak trop of 0.49 on 
___. TTE ___
showed expected findings with similar WMAs compared to prior at 
___ ___ with stable EF ___. He remained chest pain 
free with resolved dyspepsia after management of gastric 
distension, hypertension and tachycardia and patient was taken 
to the OR on ___. Home Plavix resumed postoperatively. 

#Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
Developed postoperatively initially requiring ___ L,. Felt to be 
multifactorial, due to atelectasis, aspiration without evidence 
of pneumonia, and acute on chronic heart failure exacerbation. 
Outpatient records note emphysema, and though not filled, 
prescribed symbicort in past and he was given duonebs. PE was 
considered but unlikely given VQ low probability, LENIs negative 
___. He was weaned to room air and improved with IV diuresis.

# Concern for narcotic induced dysmotility: 
Patient with significant nausea and emesis that developed early 
in the morning of ___ with inability to tolerate PO, worsened 
morphine in ED. KUB ___ showed significant gastric distension 
with air but with no evidence of volvulus or bowel obstruction. 
Patient has no distal dilated loops and has bowel gas down to 
the rectum. Likely delayed gastric emptying and /or gastric 
atony, in setting of previous morphine administration. 
Eventually patient began to have bowel movements, NG tube was 
removed. He was continued on aggressive bowel regimen.

#HFrEF. 
#ICM
Last EF ___ on ___ TTE, with WMA likely etiology ischemic 
cardiomyopathy from prior insults. At least 5L net positive this 
admission, 5Lb above dry weight from ___ renal appointment. 
Restarted losartan post-operatively. Given concurrent 
challenging hypertension, afterload reduction with isosorbide, 
hydralazine was started which was well-tolerated. He was 
diuresed and discharged on home diuretic. Please obtain standing 
weights and titrate diuretics as needed.

# Question Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
# SVT:
# Recent demand NSTEMI:
Patient had uncontrolled hypertension and likely rebound 
tachycardia initially in admission in setting of inconsistent 
delivery of home clonidine iso nausea. IV metoprolol controlled 
BPs and HRs overnight on ___ (with judicious IV fluid for 
fluid losses for NGT) but pt developed itchy rash and so 
metoprolol was
stopped. Began developing AF w/ RVR overnight ___ and 
persistent ___, triggering for rates in 150s after which 
time diltiazem was initiated. Cardiology was consulted and 
recommended continuation of diltiazem. On review of EKGs, tele, 
rhythm could be consistent with other atrial tachyarrythmia, 
such as MAT. In this context, potential risks of anticoagulation 
outweighed benefits. Eventually heart rates were controlled with 
diltiazem 60mg q8h. Per cardiology, consider anticoagulation in 
future, repeat 30day monitoring. 

#Hypertension.
At home on clonidine 0.1mg TID, losartan 100mg. Recently, 
developed rash to carvedilol in outpatient setting. Pressures 
were difficult to control. Achieved reasonable control with 
blood pressures 120-160s/70s with losartan, clonidine patch, 
hydral, isosorbide, and as below diltiazem. 

#Dysphagia
#S/P partial laryngectomy
#Malnutrition
Patient was noted to be aspiration. Prior to admission, was told 
would have swallow issues due to history of laryngectomy, but 
did not have modified diet. Developed posterior arytenoid edema 
which
was revealed during initial speech and swallow evaluation of 
aspiration, thought to be due to intubation, trauma from NG 
placement, could not rule out betablocker allergy. Silent 
aspiration on repeat evaluation by speech and swallow after 
edema improved s/p dexamethasone administration. After extensive 
risk
regarding aspiration, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, 
and death, patient and family decided to po intake and preferred 
no restriction of consistencies. 

# Anemia, acute on chronic:
Slow downtrend postoperatively. 7.1 ___ iso fluid 
administration. Likely contribution from acute illness, 
operative losses. Transfused 1 U PRBC app ___. On Procrit as 
outpatient, which should be considered if rehab stay is 
prolonged. 

#Posterior arytenoid swelling
#Metoprolol allergy
In setting of concern for aspiration, speech and swallow 
conducted fiberoptic FEES exam which revealed  laryngeal edema 
without friable tissue or appreciable fluid collection. He was 
then evaluated by ENT who felt the bilateral nature of edema and 
location possibly due to recent intubation versus NG tube 
attempts, but could not rule out allergic reaction to 
metoprolol. He was treated with a short course of dexamethasone 
and edema improved on serial fiberoptic exam. Patient may follow 
up with ENT 2 weeks after discharge. Patient may also follow-up 
with his ENT provider, Dr. ___. 

#Metoprolol allergy:
Developed severe rash after ___ metoprolol administration, and 
subsequent aspiration, and was found to have laryngeal edema as 
above. While trauma is a possible explanation for edema, must 
note that laryngeal edema occurred after administration to 
metoprolol, to which he had severe skin reaction, with 
increasing concern for aspiration in the ___ after 
administration which was likely due to airway narrowing, raised 
the question of anaphylaxis. After discussion with ENT, it was 
determined that it would be difficult to definitely attribute 
reaction to drug administration, but given degree of reaction 
and potential consequences, anaphylaxis to metoprolol as 
allergy. Patient and family were informed of this and cautioned 
regarding this allergy. 

#Hematuria:
#Foley:
Noted ___ after report of tugged foley. No clots, at risk for 
bleeding on DAPT. Tamsulosin started ___ in anticipation of 
projected void trial. Please attempt to remove foley ___.

CHRONIC:
========
# Gout. Continued home allopurinol ___ mg daily.

# DM II. Held home glipizide while inpatient. Insulin sliding 
scale with 5U basal used with adequate glycemic control.

# Hypothyroidism. Continued home levothyroxine 25 mcg daily.

# Hx CVA. Patient with residual left arm weakness. Plavix 
resumed.

>30 minutes spend on patient discharge planning and 
coordination. Of note family aware of low Hgb and plan to 
recheck it. We debated risk and benefits of given blood and 
given relatively asymptomatic, leaned towards restarting Procrit 
as outpatient or at rehab and monitor Hgb closely (especially 
given hematuria has significantly improved).

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 
  
It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You were admitted to the hospital after a fall

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You were found to have a fracture of your right proximal 
femur, part of your hip joint
- You were initially admitted to the surgery service but 
transferred to the medicine service for management of your 
medical problems while waiting for surgery
- Your hip fracture was repaired by the orthopedics team
- You developed significant nausea, vomiting and abdominal 
distension on the first day of your hospital stay.  You had a 
nasogastric tube placed to decompress your stomach until you 
started to have bowel movements.
- You had throat swelling. This could have been due to having 
the breathing tube placed for your surgery. It also could have 
been due to a medication called metoprolol that was given. 
Because of this, you should not take metoprolol.
- You were seen by our ear, nose and throat doctors and treated 
with medication to help the swelling
- You had difficulty swallowing. You were seen by our speech and 
swallow experts. When you swallow, food and liquid goes to your 
lung. We discussed that if you eat there is a risk of 
aspirating, which can cause difficulty breathing, pneumonia, and 
death. However, you are choosing to eat knowing that risk 
because this is important to your quality of life.
- You had high blood pressures and fast heart rates as a result 
of not being able to take your home medications. Your heart 
rates and blood pressures came under better control with 
additional medications.
- You were given medication to get rid of extra fluid
  
 WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  
 - Please take your medications and go to your follow up 
appointments as described in this discharge summary.  
 - Weigh yourself every day. If your weight goes up more than 
3lbs in one day, call your doctor. You may need an adjustment in 
your water pill. Your discharge weight is: 197.51 lb
 - You have an allergy to metoprolol, a beta blocker medication, 
that causes anaphylaxis. It is extremely important to inform all 
health care providers about this reaction and avoid this 
medication.
 - If you experience any of the danger signs listed below, 
please call your primary care doctor or go to the emergency 
department immediately.   

 We wish you the best!  

 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Team  
 
Followup Instructions:
