CT L-Spine: 1. Transitional anatomy at L1. 2. L4-S1 posterior 
instrumented fusion without evidence of hardware-related 
complications. 3. Unchanged moderate L5 vertebral body 
compression fracture, s/p  vertebroplasty, with unchanged mild 
retropulsion.  4. Evaluation of intraspinal detail by CT is 
limited. Evaluation for a fluid collection in the surgical bed 
is also limited by hardware-related artifacts. MRI could provide 
more information, if indicated. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history or recent posterior fusion L4/L5 complicated by 
DVT in lower left extremity at rehab, on lovenox and coumadin, 
initially presented with bilateral thigh pain found to have 
BRBPR on rectal exam.

# Thigh Pain - Evaluated by ortho-spine in the ED, recommended 
CT L-spine on admission.  CT showed expected post-operative

had with GI and patient on night of admission.  GI recommended 
colonoscopy in the morning, patient decined.  On repeat rectal 
exam, trace blood was associated with large externial

requesting to be sent home with outpatient follow-up.  CBC will 
be drawn 48 hours after discharge and sent to PCP.  Patient was
