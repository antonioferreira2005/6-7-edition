IMAGING: 
========
LEFT TIB/FIB X RAY ___:
In comparison to study of ___, there is little 
change in the 
appearance of the medial fixation plate about a fracture of the 
proximal 
tibia.  No hardware-related complication.  The oblique fracture 
line is still 
seen. 

XRAY ___:
Overall stable appearance of the chest with volume loss 
involving the right hemi thorax and right hilar opacity.  No 
focal consolidation identified to suggest infectious process. 

CHEST X RAY ___: 
Since ___, new NG tube is seen coiled in the upper 
esophagus.  Small right pleural effusion is identified.  Again 
seen is the known right perihilar radiation fibrosis, better 
assessed on prior CT chest.  A right PICC line tip terminates in 
the low SVC.  The heart size is unchanged. Aortic calcifications 
are noted.  No pneumothorax. 
 
NASOGASTRIC TUBE PLACEMENT ___
Successful placement of ___ feeding 
tube, 
terminating within the third portion of the duodenum.  The tube 
is ready to use. 

LEFT TIB/FIB XRAY ___:
The patient is status post revision surgery with exchange of the 
previously placed antibiotic spacer device.  A new antibiotic 
impregnated cement spacer is in-situ along the lateral aspect of 
the tibial plateau.  A medial fracture plate transfixes an 
oblique fracture in the proximal tibia.  Ghost tracks related to 
the prior surgery are again seen.  Subtly increased lucency 
along the medial femoral condyle is concerning for infection 
however this is similar in appearance when compared to the prior 
study. 

CXR Portable ___
Right PIC line ends in the upper SVC.  Esophageal feeding tube 
ends in the
distal stomach.  Right juxta hilar mass is smaller and less in 
___.  Small
right pleural effusion persists.  Heart size normal.  Left lung 
clear. 
Thoracic aorta is generally large and tortuous but not focally 
dilated. 
Fullness in the lower paratracheal station of the mediastinum 
could be
adenopathy or venous engorgement, but is unchanged since ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with a history of stage IV-V CKD, NSCLC s/p 
chemo/radiation) and CAD s/p PCI, complicated course with left 
tibial post-op wound dehiscence, MSSA wound infection and 
concern for non-healing wound s/p I&D on ___, now on 
suppressive IV antibiotics.

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
===============
# Wound infection vs. dehiscence: Initial clinical exam notable 
for weepy but non-exudative surgical site, L tib/fib Xray 
showing little change in the appearance of the medial fixation 
plate w/ no hardware-related complications. He was taken to the 
OR on ___ for incision and drainage, which revealed frank pus 
and further deterioration of soft tissue surrounding surgical 
site. He was briefly put on IV vanc but on ___ resumed 
cefazolin 1g q12h in addition to rifampin per previous ID plan. 
He was taken to the OR on ___ for I&D, removal of wound VAC, 
and evaluation of flap. It was determined at that time his flap 
was dusky and the wound was healing poorly, with little chance 
of source control at that site. At family meeting on ___, the 
family was informed that his left lower leg was not healing as 
expected and could require an AKA. Plastic surgery evaluated the 
patient and, in extended discussion with patient and his family, 
decision was made to proceed with limb preservation therapy as 
possible. Decision was made to continue cefazolin and rifampin 
to complete a 6 week course on ___ then to further evaluate 
the wound and determine further treatment options. 

# Severe malnutrition: pt was found to have malnutrition and was 
started on supplementation per nutrition. On ___, he had a 
nasogastric tube advanced in ___ suite after failed attempt on 
the floor and was started on tube feeds. He was noted to have 
nausea and vomiting; however emesis did not have appearance of 
tube feed residuals. Initially, nepro given but was switched to 
two cal per family request. However, developed hyperkalemia and 
had to be switched back to nepro with resolution of 
hyperkalemia. He was continued on tube feeds until ___ when his 
nasogastric tube became clogged. It was removed and the patient 
refused to have a new tube placed. He was subsequently unable to 
maintain adequate caloric intake, and feeding tube was replaced 
on ___ with the plan to resume tube feeds at rehab. During the 
hospitalization he was started on marinol as an appetite 
stimulant. 

# Nausea management: maintained on Zofran IV and discharged with 
PO zofran. 

# Hypercalcemia: Patient had corrected Ca ___ and fluctuated 
back to normal during the hospital course. PTHrp was within 
normal limits. The most likely cause is hypercalcemia of kidney 
disease in addition to immobilization and resulting bone 
breakdown. Resolved by time of discharge. 

# Anemia: Pt had post-op anemia superimposed on anemia of 
chronic disease and renal disease. He received 1 PRBC for Hgb 
<7.0 this admission. His hemoglobin on discharge was 7.1.

# Coagulopathy: elevated INR, likely due to nutritional 
deficiency/poor appetite. He was given 5 mg IV vitamin K before 
his procedure on ___. INR improved to 1.1 with improved 
nutrition.

# Pain management:  Initially Tylenol, oxycodone ___ Q4H PRN, 
flexeril 5 mg PRN. Oxycodone was stopped as his pain improved 
and that it was making him drowsy and could have possibly been 
contributing to nausea. Was started on tramadol instead. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# CKD: Creatinine fluctuated 2.4-3.2 during hospitalization, 
within recent baseline of ~3 and consistent with stage IV CKD.  

#CAD: Continued home aspirin, metop tartrate 25mg BID while 
in-house and switched back to 50mg toprol xl on discharge, and 
statin.  

#Hypertension: Continue home amlodipine, metoprolol

#Bipolar affective disorder: Continue home dose depakote. Pt's 
depakote level noted to be 8 (50-100 WNL).  Dose was changed to  
Valproic Acid ___ mg PO QHS. Of note, pt's family expressed 
strong feelings regarding dose changes, and future changes 
should be done only in collaboration with pt's family.

***Transitional issues***: 
==================
[] OPAT Antimicrobial Regimen and Projected Duration: Cefazolin 
1 gm IV q 12 h and Rifampin 450 mg PO q 12 h, projected end 
date: ___. 
[] Weekly CBC with differential, BUN, Cr, AST, ALT, TB, ALK 
PHOS, ESR/CRP
All lab results should be sent to ___ CLINIC - FAX: 
___. 
[] Depakote: pt was noted to have a Depakote level of 8 (normal 
50-100).  Patient was discharged on valproic Acid ___ mg PO QHS 
.
[] Left knee flap site with poor wound healing.  Please assess 
wound/incision daily for signs of infection and/or further 
breakdown.  Cleanse wound and apply clean, dry dressing daily.  
Patient should wear knee immobilizer to Left knee when OOB (may 
remove when lying in bed for comfort) and should not have any 
ROM to the left knee as it is stressing the incision/wound.  
This will be re-assessed at Dr. ___ surgery follow up 
appointment.
[] recheck CBC on ___. Transfuse 1 unit RBCs if hemoglobin 
less than 7.
[] On day of discharge, patient had CXR to confirm NG placement 
and was found to have a possible consolidation in the left lower 
lobe not seen on prior CXR. However, clinically there was no 
evidence of pneumonia; afebrile, no white count, no cough. 
Should be monitored for any symptoms as outpatient.
