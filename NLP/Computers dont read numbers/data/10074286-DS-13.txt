Preliminary Report !! WET READ !!  
no hydronephrosis, stones or masses. right renal cyst unchanged 
from recent CT 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute Renal Failure, Stage II Chronic Kidney Disease
- Possible etiologies are medications: lisinopril and 
allopurinol. We stopped these medications with dramatic 
improvement back to his baseline.
- The unusual time course is somewhat puzzling given that he 
went up extremely quickly and returned equally quickly, 
particularly with little intervention other than holding his 
medications and possible IV hydration in the ED. Given the 
concern of the wife that he may have accidentally taken an extra 
dose of his ACEI. 
- Change dose of allopurinol to renally dosed
- Hold ACEI until his PCP can ___. Given that he will be 
getting a ___ PCP in ___, ___ asked the wife to get a ___ PCP on 
___ out in ___, then we can fax the ___ PCP the discharge 
summary.
- FENa of 2.3% makes ATN most likely etiology, but this should 
not resolve this quickly 

2. Pedal Edema
- This again self resolved, which either is acute fluid overload 
due to hydration in the ED, or some acute diastolic failure that 
was un-noticed
- Note patient is on nifedipine

3. Type 2 Diabetes Controled without complications
- Held oral antiglycemics
- ___ restart, although at borderline createnine for glyburide
- ISS coverage

4. Eosinophilia
- There is no reason for this patient to be esosinophilic, 
although his absolute count is at borderline. I have asked the 
clinical pathology resident to review the slide as several other 
patients are also unexpectedly eosinophilic

5. CAD Native Vessle
- ACE held
- Metoprolol, Lipitor, Nifedipine
- Aspirin

6. Anaplastic Lymphoma
- Seen by Dr. ___ day of admission
- ___ in remission

7. Blindness
- Falls Precautions
