Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ is a ___ year old man with a history of IDDM2 
(uncontrolled), poorly differentiated gastric CA T2N0Mx s/p 
subtotal gastrectomy (___) admitted with fever and weakness.

# Fever / Sepsis
# Weakness
# Hypotension (transiently): Admitted with high fevers (103 at 
home), hypotension, WBC 11.1. His only localizing symptoms on 
admission were a sore throat (with normal exam) and dysuria 
(+pyuria, but UCx NGTD). CXR was normal. He was started on 
ceftriaxone for a presumed UTI but urine culture returned with 
no growth. He was maintained on antibiotics until blood cultures 
were without growth for 3 days. CBC differential was notable for 
monocytosis on admission, suggesting a viral process. AT time of 
discharge, patient had been afebrile for 72 hours, blood 
cultures were still without growth, patient was feeling 
subjectively much improved: tolerating regular diet, having more 
engery and walking independently and steadily in the hallways. 
Antibiotics were stopped and he was discharged to home with 
intent to follow-up with his PCP. 

# IDDM2
# Hyperglycemia: Blood sugars were elevated during admission, 
ranging from 200-350. FSBS correlated well with patient's 
continuous glucose monitor. He was maintained on home glargine 
dosing, a diabetic diet and was kept on a sliding scale in favor 
of his home correctional scale short acting. 

# Depression/Anxiety: Continued home citalopram and clonazepam
# Asthma/COPD: Continue home advair.
# HTN: Decreased home metoprolol to 12.5.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had a fever and 
felt weak. Ther was concern that you had a bacterial infection 
and you were treated with antibiotics. Your blood and urine work 
indicated that you did not clearly have an infection and your 
antibiotics were stopped. You did not have any further fevers 
and with time, your weakness and energy improved. We believe 
your symptoms were likely due to a viral infection.

Please note that your metoprolol has been decreased to 12.5mg 
daily (from 25mg daily)

You will need to follow-up with your primary care doctor after 
you leave the hospital. 

Please take all medications as prescribed and keep all scheduled 
doctor's appointments. Seek medical attention if you develop a 
worsening or recurrence of the same symptoms that originally 
brought you to the hospital, experience any of the warning signs 
listed below, or have any other symptoms that concern you.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!
Your ___ Care Team
