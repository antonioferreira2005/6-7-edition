Unread
My wet read- no acute pulmonary process, 2 masses in pelvis, 
each approx 2-3 cm in diameter

Pelvic MRI ___  
FINDINGS: Small amount of free fluid within the pelvis is likely
physiologic. 
The bladder appears unremarkable. The visualized portions of the
small and large bowel loops in the pelvis show no abnormality.
Multiple subcutaneous injection sites are also noted in the 
lower
abdomen. Degenerative changes are seen about the pubic 
symphysis.
Muscle atrophy is present about the hip joints. Heterogeneous
signal within the visualized portion of the lumbosacral spine 
(T1
hypointense and STIR hyperintense) is compatible with the
patient's known diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Multiple T1
hypointense, STIR hyperintense lesions are seen about the
proximal femur and femoral neck as well as in the left 
acetabulum
and left ischium, the extent of lytic lesions within the left
acetabulum is concerning for 
pathologic fracture risk, although no evidence of such exists at
this time. 
IMPRESSION: Within the limits of the imaging sequences acquired,
multiple myelomatous lesions of the left proximal femur and
acetabulum placing the risk at increased risk for pathologic
fracture. 

___ ___ IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis 
in the bilateral lower 
extremities. 

___ ECHO  IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. The basal 
inferolateral segment is probably hypokinetic. Mild mitral 
regurgitation.

___ ___ IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis 
in the bilateral lower 
extremities. 

___ ECHO  IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. The basal 
inferolateral segment is probably hypokinetic. Mild mitral 
regurgitation.

___ CYTOLOGY OF CORE BIOPSY:
NEOPLASTIC CELLS PRESENT,
 consistent with plasmacytoma.

___ CXR:  No acute cardiopulmonary process

___ CT abd/pelvis:  
The lung bases demonstrate bilateral small nonhemorrhagic 
pleural 
effusions which have slightly increased in size since prior 
chest CT.  There is adjacent compressive atelectasis.  A 
punctate ground-glass nodule is again seen in the base of the 
left lower lobe (2B:3).  There are no new nodules or masses 
seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The imaged portion of the 
heart is unremarkable.  Hypoattenuation of the blood pool may 
relate to anemia.  A 
central catheter tip is only partially imaged.  Calcified 
plaques along the right hemidiaphragm are redemonstrated. 
  
Evaluation of the intra-abdominal contents is limited by the 
lack of IV contrast.  The liver appears nodular in contour, 
concerning for underlying intrinsic liver disease.  There is 
evidence of portal hypertension with mild perisplenic and 
perihepatic ascites and splenomegaly measuring 14.8 cm in the 
craniocaudal dimension.  The pancreas and adrenal glands are 
grossly unremarkable.  There is no hydronephrosis or 
nephrolithiasis noted within the kidneys.  Scattered 
retroperitoneal lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria 
for lymphadenopathy.  The stomach, large and small bowel are 
normal without evidence for obstruction.  Evaluation of vessel 
patency is again limited by the lack of contrast.  An infrarenal 
inferior vena cava filter is noted. 
  
PELVIS:  The bladder and rectum are normal.  The uterus is not 
easily identified.  The previously seen presacral mass is no 
longer visualized.  While some asymmetry of the piriformis 
musculature persists, no identifiable infiltrative mass is 
visualized.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.  A trace amount 
of free fluid is present. 
  
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES:  Throughout the subcutaneous fat, there 
are multiple, fairly dense well-defined nodules, with the 
largest measuring 2.8 x 1.9 cm (2:50) which has slightly 
increased in size.  A nodule in the left posterior soft tissue 
has slightly decreased in size (2:37). The overall number of 
these nodules appears unchanged. Calcifications overlying the 
gluteus muscles may relate to injection granulomas.   
  
There are innumerable lytic lesions throughout the spine and 
other bones.  A superior endplate deformity of L1 has not 
progressed since the prior CT.  There is mild anterolisthesis of 
L4 on L5 which is unchanged.  Prior resection of lower lumbar 
posterior elements is again noted.  There are partially healed 
fractures involving the left ischial tuberosity and a non-united 
pathologic fracture involving the left posterior ninth rib. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Widespread osseous metastatic lesions which are grossly 
unchanged from 
prior. 
  
2.  Significant decrease in size of a presacral soft tissue 
mass. 
  
3.  Persistent numerous subcutaneous nodules which are known 
sites of myeloma 
involvment, some of which have increased and others which have 
decreased in 
size. 

___ DUPPLEX DOPPLER ABD/PELVIS 
1.  Cirrhotic liver, without focal lesions or biliary dilation. 
Splenomegaly 
and small ascites. 
2.  Patent hepatic vasculature.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with a history of stroke/dementia and multiple 
myeloma (IgG Kappa) who presented from rehab with worsening 
diarrhea, fevers, and LDH >1000.  She has completed 3 cycles of 
velcade/decadron (last dose ___, and has been receiving 
radiation this month to her L hip for treatment of a myelomatous 
bony lesion.  She was supposed to receive a dose of 
velcade/decadron on ___, but due to feeling feverish with a 
cough, dose was held and augmentin and erythromycin were 
initiated for possible PNA. She returned to clinic ___ still 
feeling unwell. CT Torso revealed no acute pulmonary process, 
but there are lung nodules. Incidentally, there was a 4X5mm soft 
tissue mass in the pre-sacral area. She was found to have 
elevated LDH>1000 on admission, which is likely due to a soft 
tissue masses.  Biopsy of an abdominal wall nodule was confirmed 
to be plastmacytoma, so she was started on Cycle one of 
Velcade/Decadron/Cyclophosphamide on ___ for progressive 
disease.

On arrival, pt was placed on broad spectrum Abx, but these were 
discontinued due to low suspicion for infectious process.  C. 
diff and stool studies were negative, as with multiple blood and 
urine cultures. 

# Multiple Myeloma (IgG Kappa):  Patient presented with 
worsening disease after 3 cycles of velcade/decadron.  She has 
lytic lesions in the left acetabulum, multiple subcutaneous 
plasmacytomas (the likely cause of her elevated LDH on 
admission, which trended down with VCD), and protein 
electrophoresis showed increased IgG kappa.  She is s/p 3 cycles 
of velcade and Day 1 of VCD was ___.  She developed 
transfusion-dependent pancytopenia and Day 8 was held starting 
on ___, and she was given neupogen until her counts recovered. 
 She apparently had good response to VCD as the presacral mass 
decreased on repeated imaging and her LDH trended down.
We continued prophylaxis with atovaquone and acyclovir.  

# Pancytopenia - The patient developed pancytopenia in the 
setting of chemotherapy, and received blood and platelet 
tranfusions.  Chemotherapy was held as described above, and her 
counts remained stable without transfusions.  She was given 
neupogen until her counts recovered.  On the day of discharge, 
her ANC was 832, so she was given one dose of neupogen 300mcg.
 
# Lytic bone lesion left acetabulum and proximal femur - MRI 
showed lytic bony lesions placing her at high risk for 
fractures.  Orthopedic surgery and physical therapy were 
consulted, and recommended that she continue partial 
weight-bearing with a walker and use a TLSO brace.

# Fever - patient had low grade temperatures throughout the 
hospitalization but no infectious source was identified.  She 
was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics while neutropenic, but 
antibiotics were discontinued on ___ and she remained afebrile 
but had low grade temperatures around 99.5F.  Fevers are most 
likely medication-related or associated with multiple myeloma.

# Diarrhea - Patient has chronic diarrhea of unclear etiology.  
No infectious sources identified, repeated C. diff testing was 
negative.  Diarrhea may be related to local radiation treatment 
or antibiotics.  TTG was negative, suggesting against celiac 
disease, but IgA is also low, so celiac disease cannot be ruled 
out.

# Elevated alk phos / Intrinsic liver disease? - Patient had 
elevated alk phos and GGT (thought likely related to bone 
turnover) but CT imaging showed hetereogeneity of the liver 
parenchyma suggestive of intrinsic liver disease.  After 
discussion with liver specialists, we obtained duplex ultrasound 
which showed patent hepatic vessels.  Hepatitis panel was 
negative.  Iron studies not suggestive of hemochromatosis.  She 
likely has well-compensated cirrhosis from non-alcoholic steatic 
hepatitis, given that her other LFTs and her coags were within 
acceptable ranges.  Several studies are still pending upon 
discharge, including fractionated alkaline phosphatase, blood 
ceruloplasmin, ___, AMA, anti-smooth muscle 
Ab.  She should be seen by liver specialists as an outpatient 
for follow-up.

Chronic / stable issues
# Dementia - Patient has likely vascular dementia, and memory 
loss secondary to a remote stroke.  On some days, she is able to 
state her diagnosis but other days she was unable to recount the 
events of the past day.  She did not seem to have insight into 
her disease.

# DVT s/p IVC filter in ___

# Fluid overload / weight gain - The patient developed fluid 
overload in setting of receiving IVF for diarrhea and fevers, 
which improved with PO lasix.

# Hypertension - We continued home metoprolol and lisinopril.  
Aspirin was held for thrombocytopenia.

# Hyperlipidemia -We continued home simvastatin

# NIDDM - We stopped home glipizide and kept her on an insulin 
sliding scale while in house, she developed hyperglycemia in the 
setting of dexamethasone as part of her VCD.

#GERD - We continued home omeprazole

#Depression - We continued home fluoxetine

#Back Pain - We continued home short and long acting oxycodone 
regimen.

# ACCESS: Tunneled line in double-lumen Power Port-A-Cath in

# CODE: Confirmed Full
# EMERGENCY CONTACT: daughter ___ (health care proxy)
# DISPO:  Has a private bed at ___ of ___, ambulates 
with walker, needs assistance with personal care / ADLs

# CAPACITY EVALUATION / GUARDIANSHIP - She was seen by 
psychiatry (Dr. ___ and deemed to have no capacity to 
make medical decisions as she is unable to express consistent 
choices and appreciate how medical info applies to her 
condition.  She seems to have a component of denial.  The 
patient's daughter is her health care proxy but she has not been 
involved during this hospitalization.  Social work is attempting 
to contact her daughter and request a transfer of health care 
proxy status to a legal guardian.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure caring for you during your hospitalization.  
You were hospitalized for fevers and diarrhea, for which you 
received a short course of IV antibiotics.  Thorough evaluation 
of possible infectious causes of your fever did not reveal any 
clear source of infection so the antibiotics were stopped.  A CT 
scan of your abdomen revealed several masses under the skin.  A 
biopsy was performed, which revealed that you have small cancers 
called plasmacytomas, which is likely related to progression of 
multiple myeloma.  Because of this, you started chemotherapy, 
which you tolerated well.  You received blood and platelet 
transfusions when your blood counts dropped because of 
chemotherapy.
