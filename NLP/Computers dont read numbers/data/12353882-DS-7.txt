History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with PMH of HTN, HLD, DM and CAD

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old woman who was brought in after 
being found down and was subsequently diagnosed with left M1 
occlusion resulting in a stroke involving mostly the superior 
division and lenticulostriates. 
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
# Stroke: She was started on heparin as a bridge to warfarin as 
she had a large thrombus in her left M1 while her inferior M2 
did appear patent. There was concern that clot might migrate or 
expand, significantly worsening her stroke. Plan to continue 
coumadin for 3 months. She was started on atorvastatin and 
metformin as well given her risk factors (see "labs" above). 
There was no obvious cardiac source on TTE or carotid source on 
CTA. She was started on metformin and atorvastatin. Blood 
pressure regimen was gradually re-introduced after a period of 
permissive HTN; she is currently on her home regimen except for 
Diovan, which can be re-introduced as pressures tolerate to a 
goal systolic of 100-130.
.
# INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS: Patient was started on 
metformin given improved kidney function from baseline and 
utility of weight loss. She was continued on a sliding scale 
without long-acting initially; her home NPH was resumed on 
___ and should be titrated to euglycemia. 
.
# RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Admitted with creatinine slightly better 
than baseline. Appeared to be slightly hypovolemic on ___ so 
furosemide decreased on ___ from 40 to 30mg daily. Please 
titrate furosemide to euvolemia.  
.
# HTN: HELD isosorbide and Diovan during hospitalization; 
pressures within acceptable range without this. Atenolol was 
given at half-dose (12.5mg daily) during hospital stay. Her 
former home meds may be GRADUALLY resumed if her SBPs are > 140

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Stroke: Plan to continue coumadin for 3 months. Please check 
INR daily until stable in the ___ range. ___ stop heparin drip 
when INR > 2. Until that time, check PTT q6 hours with a goal 
PTT 40-60; adjust heparin drip as needed. Follow up with 
___ as below. 
.
# Nutrition: Passed speech and swallow but make sure pt is alert 
and sitting up at meal times. ___ require maintenance fluids, 
dietary supplementation.
.
# HLD: Follow for signs of discomfort that might indicate 
myalgias (occurred with pravastatin in the past or elevation in 
creatinine (check CK); started atorvastatin ___ and has had 
myalgias with simvastatin in the past. 
.
# HTN: HELD Diovan during hospitalization; please resume Diovan 
as pressures tolerate (goal is now normotension, SBP 100-130). 
Atenolol was given at half-dose (12.5mg daily) during hospital 
stay. 
.
# CKD: Admitted with creatinine better than baseline; home dose 
lasix 40 BID but lowered here. Appeared to be slightly 
hypovolemic on ___ so furosemide further decreased on ___ 
from 40 to 30mg daily. Please titrate furosemide to euvolemia. 
.
# Diabetes: Follow for response on metformin. Continue on 
sliding scale; increase as needed (she is on her home dose of 
NPH/Novolin N)
.
# Thyroid nodule: Please order follow-up ultrasound for further 
evaluation of isthmus.

Primary diagnosis: Stroke

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ were admitted to the neurology service at the ___ 
because of a stroke on the left side of your brain which has 
interfered with your ability to move the right side of your body 
and your ability to produce and understand speech. The exact 
source of the clot is not completely clear, but based on the 
evidence we have, it would be prudent to give ___ an 
anticoagulant called coumadin for 3 months. We hope that this 
will prevent the clot which has blocked off one of your blood 
vessels from expanding and blocking off nearby vessels which 
also supply areas of the brain important for speech. 

___ will follow up with Dr. ___ in neurology as dictated 
below.

Your medication list has changed; your rehab facility will 
provide ___ an updated list before discharge. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
