Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ with low 
blood pressure and chest pressure.  These symptoms resolved 
after you received IV fluids, leading us to believe that they 
were caused by too much fluid removed during hemodialysis.  We 
ruled out a risk of blockage in your coronary arteries through 
blood tests overnight.

Additionally, you were found to have a low INR, indicating that 
your blood wasn't sufficiently thinned by the warfarin you were 
taking.  We restarted your warfarin in the hospital and would 
like you to continue taking it until you next follow up at 
clinic.

The following medications were changed during your 
hospitalization:
CONTINUED warfarin at 3 mg orally per day
DECREASED lisinopril to 5 mg orally per day

lightheadedness, shortness of breath, or any other symptoms that
