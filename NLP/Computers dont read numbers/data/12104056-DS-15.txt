Pertinent Results:
CXR PA/L ___: (my read) stable cardiomegaly, prior 
interstitial pulmonary edema has resolved, pleural effusions 
seen on lateral view slightly worsened.  

ECG ___: Sinus bradycardia w/ normal axis, LBBB, L atrial 
enlargement. Compared with ___ EKG rate is now brady, 
otherwise unchanged. 

TTE ___:
LVEF: 70%
___: 4.2cm long axis, 6.5cm four chamber length
RA: 5.5cm four chamber length, 1.3cm septal wall thickness, 
1.4cm interolateral thickness
LVOT gradient: 12mmHg
___ - ___ enlargement
RA - Mildly dilated RA. A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the 
RA. 
LV - Asymmetric LVH. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). TDI E/e' >13, 
suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. Mild resting LVOT gradient.
RV - Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion
Aorta - Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly 
dilated ascending aorta
AV - ?# aortic valve leaflets. Trace AR
MV - Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Mild (1+) 
MR. 
___ - tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate [2+] TR. Normal PA 
systolic pressure. 
PV/PA - Pulmonic valve not visualized. No PS. Physiologic PR. 
Pericardium - No pericardial effusion
CONCLUSIONS:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is asymmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy (mid septal thickness of 3.2 cm with 
evidence of prior myomectomy and thinning of the basal septum). 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is a mild resting left 
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is 
mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be 
determined. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is minimal systolic anterior motion of the 
anterior mitral leaflet. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the left ventricular outflow tract gradient is lower. Other 
findings are similar

placement for isorhythmic AV dissociation ___ who presents 
with ___ days of DOE, orthopnea, PND and "skin tightness" in her 
extremities after instructed to discontinue her Lasix several 
weeks prior.

# dHF ___ HOCM (LVEF >70%): s/p myomectomy ___ with 
improvement in LVOT gradient on ECHO ___, still with severe 
diastolic dysfunction and now with LBBB, likely iatrogenic. Told 
to taper and then discontinue Lasix after previous discharge for 
unclear reasons. Now with volume overload with weight gain (86.7 
(discharge) > 88.0 kg (admission)), elevated BNP of 2443, CXR 
with some pulmonary edema and pleural effusion, and hypervolemia 
on exam. Received 40 iv lasix x 1 in the ED. ACS ruled out as no 
chest pain, negative troponin, no EKG changes. Will need home 
torsemide given her continuing diastolic dysfunction. Will also 
increase her metoprolol to decrease the potential for 
hyperdynamic dysfunction of her left ventricle in the setting of 
HOCM. Will need careful fluid monitoring as potential of fluid 
overload if wet and hyperdynamic dysfunction if dry. NET even on 
20mg PO Torsemide ___. Increased Metoprolol from 12.5mg > 
25mg, which was tolerated well. Recommend daily standing weights 
and 2gm sodium diet. 

# A fib: developed post-op s/p cardioversion and amiodarone. 
Currently in sinus. Not anticoagulated. CHADS2VASC = 2 (female, 
HF). Continue amiodarone 200 daily.

sinus rhythm here. Pacer intermittently pacing. 
 # OSA: continued home CPAP at night

 # Depression: continued home paroxetine 
 # Chronic Pain: continued home gabapentin

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You came to the hospital because you were having 
increased difficulty breathing. We found that you were 
experiencing heart failure; this is when the heart fails to push 
fluid forward, causing a buildup of fluid in the lungs. We 
treated you with torsemide, a medication that helps you urinate 
the extra fluid off. We also increased the dose of your 
Metoprolol (a blood pressure medication) to improve your heart's 
ability to pump fluid forward. We also did an ECHO to look at 
your heart's function: it appears to be functioning better since 
the surgery, which is good news. 

We recommend:
- Weigh yourself every day after you first urinate. Call your 
physician if you weight goes up more than 3lbs. 
- We have changed your medications. We have added the medication 
called Torsemide and increased the medication called Metoprolol. 
You can find a list of your medications below. Please read this 
list carefully and take the medications as prescribed. Please 
bring a copy of this list to your next appointment. 
- Eat a low sodium diet
- Work towards losing ___

You can talk about cardiac rehabilitation with Dr. ___ 
you see him next.

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. We are glad that you 
are feeling better!

Take Care,

Your ___ Cardiology Team
