History of Present Illness:
 Ms. ___ is a ___ RH woman with a history of HTN, TIA,
and one prior episode of peripheral vertigo who presents with 24
hours of dizziness and vomiting. She reports that she was in her
usual state of health until 2 days ago, when she had a brief
(several second) episode of room-spinning vertigo when on a boat
in the ___. This resolved with sitting and did not
recur. Yesterday evening at 5pm, she felt light-headed upon
standing and then sat down but noticed the room seemed like it
was spinning; she does not recall which direction it was moving.
She said the spinning persisted for several hours and she had
several episodes of NBNB emesis at 7pm. She eventually fell
asleep but said she had to keep still, lying on her side, in
order to sleep. This morning, the spinning sensation was still
present and became more severe after taking a shower. She had
multiple episodes of emesis this AM and had some trouble walking
though was not falling to one side or another.  

Given this, Mrs. ___ was brought to her PCP for further
evaluation.  There, there was concern about inferior-lead T-wave
inversion and she was sent in for further evaluation.  At this
point, Ms. ___ describes that she does not feel like she is
spinning but she becomes very uncomfortable upon changing
position (sitting and standing) and the spinning recurs.
Otherwise, she endorses a feeling of her head being heavy. She
denies any recent history of fever, rhinorrhea, ear pain, throat
pain, new hearing loss or sick contacts and denies neck trauma.

On neuro ROS, Ms. ___ denies headache, loss of vision,
blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, tinnitus, new
hearing loss, confusion, difficulties producing or comprehending
speech, focal weakness, numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or
bladder incontinence or retention. Endorses difficulty with gait
described above.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ RH woman with a history
of HTN, TIA, and one prior episode of presumably peripheral
vertigo who presents with 24 hours of dizziness and vomiting.
Given the history of significant spinning, seemingly worse with
movement, and the exam showing predominantly right beating
nystagmus, most prominent when looking to the right, as well as 
a
positive head impulse test on left head turn without skew
deviation, a peripheral etiology of this woman's symtpoms is 
most
likely. There is no history of infection that would be a reason 
for a
vestibular neuropathy/labrynthitis. As this patient does
have several vascular risk factors including evidence of prior
strokes on CT, she was admitted for further evaluation.  Her CT, 
CTA, and MRI were all unremarkable and would not explain her 
vertigo. Given that she does have chronic hearing loss on the 
left side, we think that her vertigo is most likely peripheral.  
For risk factor assessment: her a1c was 5.5. LDL is pending at 
this time. There was no medication changes made in this 
admission.  Patient was symptomatically much improved on the day 
of discharge.
