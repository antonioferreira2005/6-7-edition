Notable studies:
TTE:There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal 
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left 
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is 
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral 
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Grossly preserved biventricular systolic function. 
Limited study.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic 
back pain, depression/anxiety admitted with pre-syncope 

#Pre-syncope/autonomic neuropathy:
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction and it was not 
felt that the patient's symptoms were related to cardiac 
ischemia or structural cardiac abnormality as echocardiogram was 
unremarkable. The patient was seen by Neurology and felt to most 
probably have autonomic neuropathy related to her diabetes. The 
patient will be evaluated by Dr. ___ for ___ table 
testing and further workup for autonomic neuropathy. 
Additionally, the patient's lisinopril was discontinued and the 
patient was without symptoms of orthostasis prior to discharge. 
She also did well with physical therapy prior to discharge.

#Urinary tract infection:
Patient was treated with ciprofloxacin for 7 days for 
enterobacter urinary tract infection.

#Type 2 DM uncontrolled, with complications of neuropathy and 
nephropathy:
Patient was maintained on her home NPH and humalog sliding 
scale.
 
#Hypertension/Chronic renal failure, stage III: 
As above ACE inhbitor was held for symptoms of orthostasis. 
Given her chronic renal failure most probably related to 
diabetes, ACE inhibitor should be restarted at a lower dose if 
tolerated once the patient is stable without significant 
pre-syncopal symptoms. This can be followed by her PCP.

#Chronic obstructive lung disease:
Patient was continued on her home inhaled fluticasone.

#Depression/Anxiety with Panic attack:
Patient was seen by Psychiatry and managed with seroquel for 
episodes of panic. The patient had stopped her Cymbalta 3 weeks 
prior to admit because she was going to start a study drug 
through the ___, but she was told 
that she is not eligible due to her neuropathy. Therefore, she 
was discharged to restart her Cymbalta gradually back to her 
previous Cymbalta dose of 60mg po daily over the next 3 weeks. 
She was instructed to follow up with her PCP and potentially try 
to obtain a Psychiatrist for management of her depression and 
anxiety if her symptoms do not improve once back on her 
Cymbalta.

#Chronic back pain: 
Patient was continued on her home percocet and lyrica. 

#Hyperlipidemia: Pt was continued on her statin

#CODE: FULL

#Disposition: Patient was discharged home with services and will 
follow up with her PCP regarding her orthostasis, presyncope, 
hypertension, diabetes, and anxiety. She will also follow up 
with Dr. ___ for further management of her likely 
autonomic neuropathy.
