Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was intubated upon arrival and was found to be 
hypotensive, minimally responsive to recussitation with blood 
and crystalloid. She had a positive FAST exam and was taken 
emergently to the operating room. She was found to have a 
splenic laceration and left kidney laceration, and underwent 
splenectomy, and left nephrectomy. The remainder of the abdomen 
was explored and no other sources of bleeding were identified. 
Please see dictated operative report for further details. The 
patient was transferred to the ICU for further recussitation. 
Upon neurological exam in the ICU it was found that her left 
pupil was now also fixed and dilated along with the right which 
had been since initial evaluation in the ED. She had no gag 
reflex or corneal reflex, and no longer had purposeful movement, 
but was at times overbreathing the ventillator. She continued to 
be hypotensive on pressors and with blood products being 
transfused. Her abdomen was opened in the ICU for a bedside 
ex-lap. Diffuse oozing was seen, likely due to coagulopathy, but 
no large sources of bleeding that could be corrected. Her 
abdomen was left open. Initially upon re-entering her abdomen 
her pressures improved, but then again slowly continued to trend 
down. Given the cumulative blood loss from her abdomen, head, 
b/l lower extremeties, it was difficult to keep her adequately 
perfused even with crystalloid, blood products, and pressors. 
Massive transfusion protocol was initiated upon arrival and she 
received >38 Units of blood product. She remained hypothermic 
throughout most of the recussitation even with warmed product, 
fluids, and bear hugger.
A discussion was had with her husband, sister, neice, and family 
friends in the ICU meeting room, and given the extent of her 
injuries, and likely unrecoverable neurological status, the 
decision was made to change her code status to comfort measures 
only, and the patient expired shortly thereafter.
