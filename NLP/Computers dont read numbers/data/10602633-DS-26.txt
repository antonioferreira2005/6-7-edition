History of Present Illness:
___ with H/O CAD s/p DES to RCA (___), HFpEF (LVEF 55-60%), 
hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, COPD (not on home O2), 
and obesity brought in by ambulance for myalgias, difficulty

has also had a non-productive cough for the past 2 days, but 
denies fevers. She endorsed rhinorrhea (at night), sore throat 
and chills. 2 days ago, she had episode of short-lived 
palpitations and some left sided muscle strain/deep ache in 
setting of washing dishes. She reported orthopnea and paroxysmal 
nocturnal dyspnea. Patient stated that she typically sleeps in 
recliner, however the evening before admission decided to sleep 
in her bed and had worsening shortness of breath. Patient does 
endorse progressively worsening bilateral lower extremity edema 
in the last month. She reports her dry weight as 312 pounds, 
however has not been weighing herself recently.

She called ___ earlier on the day of admission for diffuse 
arthralgias and myalgias which prevented her from arising from 
bed. She has had arthralgias for several months and despite 
taking gabapentin has had no improvement in her symptoms. She 
stated that she'll intermittently drop items like pans while 
taking them out of the oven. 

She denied GI symptoms. Patient also reported urinary urgency 
with mild incontinence upon standing for about one year. Patient 
is able to sense when she has to urinate, however upon standing 
will intermittently lose control of her bladder. She reported 
darker urine from baseline ("brown" in the last few days) and 
intentional decreased PO intake. She reported no changes to her 
medication regimen recently.

auscultation. Benign cardiac and abdominal exam. Bilateral lower 
extremity edema. EKG showed sinus rhythm vent rate 81, normal 
axis, no acute ischemic changes. Labs notable for  Normal CBC, 
coags, CMP, LFTs, first Trop-T <0.01, ProBNP 1857, UA with few 
bacteria and <1 WBC. CXR showed "Moderate enlargement of the 
cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusion. Possible minimal 
pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema." 
Patient was given gabapentin 300 mg and furosemide 40 mg IV.

___ 10:00AM BLOOD Calcium-9.3 Phos-3.8 Mg-2.___ with H/O CAD s/p DES to RCA (___), HFpEF (LVEF 55-60%), 
hypertension, type 2 diabete mellitus, COPD, and obesity 
presented with myalgias, difficulty ambulating and dyspnea. Her 
dyspnea was thought to be consistent with HFpEF exacerbation, as 
her pro-BNP was elevated at 1857 with radiographic possible 
minimal pulmonary vascular congestion. She was 315lbs on 
admission (dry weight thought to be 312 lbs). She was diuresed 
with furosemide 40 and 80 mg IV boluses. Unfortunately, she 
developed ___ (Cr rising from 1.1 to 1.4) and 
lightheadedness, requiring treatment with 1 L NS on ___ and 
meclizine 12.5 mg. Her diuretics were resumed at a reduced dose 
and her kidney function remained stable with Cr 1.1. She was 
continued on her home isosorbide mononitrate, losartan, and 
carvedilol. Orthostatic VS negative prior to discharge. She was 
discharged on torsemide 20 mg every other day with close 
cardiology and primary care physician follow up.

OTHER ACTIVE ISSUES:  
# Neuropathy, Difficulty Ambulating: Patient reported pain and 
weakness in distal arms and legs that has been present for one 
year, most suggestive of diabetic neuropathy. TSH was normal. 
Her B12 level was low at 203 despite being prescribed 
cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg daily, suggesting that she may be 
missing doses. She was evaluated by OT prior to discharge home. 
Difficulty ambulating is also likely due to weight and 
deconditioning.

# Myalgias: Patient reported 'whole body aches.' Influenza A/B 
swabs were negative. Statin myopathy was less likely, as CK was 
normal at 46. Mylagias were thought most likely due viral 
syndrome, as patient reported URI symptoms on admission. 

# Vitamin D Deficiency, Vitamin B12 Deficiency: Patient was 
found to be vitamin D and B12 deficient, with 25-OH Vit D of 11 
and Vit B12 of 203, likely due to medication non-compliance as 
patient had been prescribed vit D and vit B12 supplementation. 
We continued home prescription of cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg daily, 
vit D ___ U daily, and  multivitamin. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:  
# Urinary Incontinence/ urgency: Patient reported ___ year of 
urinary incontinence and urgency. No UTI on U/A and culture.

# CAD s/p DES to RCA (___), hyperlipidemia: Continued home 
aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 80 mg QPM. Lipid profile 
showed HDL 43 and calculated LDL 124, raising the concern for 
non-compliance vs. need to escalate therapy with ezetimibe or 
PCS9-inhibitor given known CAD. We discontinued her clopidogrel 
after touching base with patient's interventional cardiologist, 
as she had been on it for over 30 months since placement of her 
DES. She was continued on carvedilol, isosorbide mononitrate, 
amlodipine and losartan.

# Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Patient placed on insulin sliding 
scale in place of home glyburide 1.25 mg and metformin 1000 mg 
BID while hospitalized.

# OSA: Patient declined CPAP  

# Hypertension: Continued home amlodipine 10 mg daily, 
carvedilol 25 mg BID, and losartan 100 mg daily.
 
# COPD: Continued home albuterol q6h:prn

# Depression/Anxiety: Continued home duloxetine ___ 60mg daily, 
lorazepam 0.5mg PRN

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# HFpEF:
DISCHARGE WEIGHT: 143.5 kg, 316.36 pounds
DISCHARGE Cr: 1.2 (baseline 1.0)
DISCHARGE DIURETIC: 20 mg torsemide every other day

TO DO:
[] Patient discharged on torsemide 20 mg every other day. Please 
check BMP on ___ to evaluate renal function on torsemide 
dose and evaluate symptoms on this regimen.  

# Neuropathy, Myalgias 
[] Consider increasing gabapentin up to 300-1200mg TID 
[] Consider referral to neurology for further workup of 
neuropathy 
[] Consider massage therapy for leg pain

# Vitamin D Deficiency
[] Patient's 25-OH Vit D level was low 11 despite being 
prescribed Vit D 2,000 units daily. Consider repleting with 
50,000 units once weekly for ___ weeks. 

# Urinary Incontinence/Urgency
[] Patient reported ___ year of urinary incontinence and urgency. 
Consider referral to uro-gynecology. 

# Hyperlipidemia
[] LDL was 124 despite being prescribed atorvastatin 80 mg QPM. 
Consider medication non-adherence vs need for ezetimibe as 
second agent. 

# CAD
[] Patient's home clopidogrel was discontinued after discussion 
with Dr. ___, as she had been on it for 4+ years s/p 
uncomplicated placement of one DES.

___!  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================  
- You were admitted because of shortness of breath  

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
-  You were admitted to the hospital because you had difficulty 
walking and you had been feeling short of breath and you were 
found to have fluid on your lungs. This was felt to be due to a 
condition called heart failure, where your heart does not pump 
hard enough and fluid backs up into your lungs. You were given a 
diuretic medication through the IV to help get the fluid out. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?
