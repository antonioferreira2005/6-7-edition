ACTIVE ISSUES:
===============================
# Fever:  As per patient, did receive influenza vaccine and 
rapid flu test was negative which makes an influenza diagnosis 
unlikely. CXR was performed in the ED that showed pulmonary 
fibrosis and bronchiectasis similar to previous but superimposed 
infection could not be excluded. With the patient receiving 
methotrexate weekly for her RA, she is immunosuprressed. Blood 
culture ___ bottle) from ___ grew micrococcus/stomatoccus 
species which is most likely a contaminant.
Patient initially started on vancomycin on ___ but 
discontinued on ___ after blood culture speciated. UA on 
admission was positive for leuks and 29 WBC but urine culture 
was contaminated, repeat UA on ___ also with posiive leuks and 
17 WBC but urine culture was with no growth and patient without 
any UTI symptoms throughout hospitalization. Stated that her 
chronic joint pain and swelling was at baseline. Clinically, 
patient improved and had no further fevers. Her fever on 
admission is most likely secondary to a viral syndrome that has 
now resolved. At discharge, she was feeling well with stable 
vital signs.    

# back rash: began on ___ and very pruritic. Appears 
macular-papular and extending to her buttocks. Likely secondary 
to heat rash as patient mostly laying on back throughout the day 
with significant perspiration. Sarna lotion was applied with 
good relief. Will need to keep area cooled and dried, and thus 
will likely improve once ambulation improves with ___ at rehab.  

# stage II sacral ulcer and R medial malleolus ulcer: appears 
stable without signs of active infection. Daily wound care 
provided. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
==============================
# a.fib: As per OMR the patient is not anticoagulated as per 
cardiologists request. She was rate controlled with metoprolol.

# Neck pain/DJD: She was continued on fentanyl patch, vicodin 
was replaced with oxycodone and tylenol PRN while admitted. 
Patient did not request oxycodone/tylenol and pain appeared to 
be well controlled on just the fentanyl patch. Discharged with 
instructions to only continue the fentanyl patch for pain. 

# RA c/b pulmonary fibrosis: patient weaned off O2 and satting 
well on RA. Her methotrexate was not given on ___. She will need 
to restart her weekly methotrexate on ___.

# HTN: She was continued on home captopril.

# HLD: She was continued on home atorvastatin and aspirin

# h/o CVA: She was continued on aspirin 81mg.

# Hypothyroidism: She was continued on her home levothyroxine. 
TSH was 1.7

# GERD: Since esomeprazole was nonformulary, she was 
administered omeprazole while in house. Her esomeprazole was 
continued on discharge.

# Depression: She was continued on her home citalopram.

# Glaucoma: She was continued on her home brimonidine drops.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===============================
-patient did not receive her weekly MTX on ___, please resume 
MTX on ___
-please ensure back rash is improving
-while hospitalized patient's pain was well controlled with only 
fentanyl patch, she was instructed to discontinue vicodin. 
Please reassess pain and adjust pain medications as appropriate
-please f/u with pending blood cultures

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at ___ 
___. You were admitted to the 
hospital because you were having fevers and felt generally weak 
at home. While here in the hospital, we determined that you did 
NOT have the flu. We also looked for other types of infections. 
A Chest Xray did not show pneumonia. Your urine did not show any 
infection. Your blood grew small amount of a bacteria but it is 
most likely a contaminant.

You had a rash on your back which improved with ambulation. 
Please make sure you keep your back dried and prevent sweating 
around that area. Use sarna lotion as needed for itchiness. We 
recommend that you use sheets without bleach or dyes in case 
this was contributing.

You improved clinically even after we discontinued your 
antibiotics, which means that you likely had a viral infection 
that cleared. You will need to go to reab to help improve your 
strength. 

Please make sure you follow up with your primary care physician 
and your ___. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
