Chief Complaint:
exertional chest pain

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___:
Coronary artery bypass grafting x4 with the left

History of Present Illness:
___ year old male who began experiencing chest pain with jogging 
up inclines or playing tennis several months ago that resolves 
with rest. He was sent
for a stress echo which demonstrated ischemic EKG changes as 
well
as chest pain. Echo portion was normal but deemed suboptimal 
with
multiple wall regions not visualized. He was referred for a
cardiac catheterization and was found to have three vessel
disease. He is now being referred to cardiac surgery for 
surgical
revascularization.

Conclusions   
 The patient exercised for 9 minutes 18 seconds according to a
___ protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart rate
of 172 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 190/60 mmHg. The test 
was
stopped because of shortness of breath and chest pain. This 
level
of exercise represents a good exercise tolerance for age. In
response to stress, the ECG showed ischemic ST changes (see
exercise report for details). There is resting hypertension.
There were normal blood pressure and heart rate responses to
stress. 
 Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 88 bpm and a
blood pressure of 150/70 mmHg. These demonstrated normal 
regional
and global left ventricular systolic function though of note
distal inferior wall not visualized. Right ventricular free wall
motion is normal. Doppler demonstrated no aortic stenosis, 
aortic
regurgitation or significant mitral regurgitation or resting 
LVOT
gradient. 
 Echo images were acquired within 45seconds after peak stress at
heart rates of 153 - 134 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate
augmentation of all left ventricular segments. There was
augmentation of right ventricular free wall motion. 
IMPRESSION: Good functional exercise capacity. Ischemic ECG
changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic evidence of
inducible ischemia to achieved workload. Resting hypertension.
Normal hemodynamic response to exercise.   

___: Intraop TEE:
Conclusions  
Prebypass

No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left 
atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen 
by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apical portion of the 
anterior septum and septum. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results on 
___ at ___ am

Post bypass

Patient is A paced and receiving an infusion of Phenylephrine. 
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. Aorta is intact 
post decannulation. Rest of examination is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was brought to the Operating Room on ___ 
where the patient underwent Coronary artery bypass grafting x4 
(left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery 
and reverse saphenous vein graft to the right acute marginal 
artery, obtuse marginal artery and diagonal artery).  Overall 
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively 
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery 
and invasive monitoring.  
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and 
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient 
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  He remained 
in the ICU for IV insulin support for hyperglycemia despite 
increase in his preop home diabetes medications.  ___ was 
consulted for assistance with management of blood glucose.  He 
also completed a course of Ciprofloxacin for fevers with +UA.  
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued 
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical 
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By 
the time of discharge on POD 8 the patient was ambulating 
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral 
analgesics.  The patient was discharged home in good condition 
with appropriate follow up instructions.
