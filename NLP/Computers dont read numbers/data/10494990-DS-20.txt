Chief Complaint:
aphasia, right arm weakness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
received tpa prior to transfer
 
History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ year old left handed male who presents 
as
transfer from ___ after presenting there with aphasia and right
arm weakness found to have left ICA occlusion now status post 
tPA
and transferred to ___ for further management. 

Patient reports he has overall been feeling well recently. He
recently went ___ for the last week and a half on
vacation with his family. He was very active, riding jet skis,
etc. He came back early this week and helped his son move into
his dorm in ___. He went back to work yesterday which
was stressful as he his ___ owner of a ___. Over 
the
past 2 days he has had some slight left frontal pressure-like
headache which he has been treating with intermittent ibuprofen
and essentially had resolved.

He woke up this morning around 6A and he again had the slight
left frontal pressure-like headache. He started to answer emails
at his computer and drank some coffee. He talked to his wife
around ___. He poured some cereal in a bowel because he was
going to eat and then realized he had to go to the bathroom so 
he
did not pour the milk. He went into the bathroom and had a bowel
movement. He did not strain with this. When he tried to get up
off the toilet he remembers thinking "this feels weird". He went
to pull up his pants and his right arm would not move to pull up
his pants. He then slowly collapsed to the floor. He felt
somewhat confused per him and couldn't grasp what was happening.
He was able to say, "I need some help in here". He could hear 
his
cat scratching at the door trying to get into the bathroom.

His wife came in the bathroom and said his face looked droopy
(unclear which side). He felt like he understood everything she
said to him but he was having trouble getting out words at 
times.
He told her she should call EMS. He also asked her for water but
stayed on the ground. When he grabbed the water cup from her he
ended up dropping it from his right hand and his right hand felt
weak. He also thought his left face and left arm felt numb like
after getting novicaine. He had no changes in his vision,
dizziness, slurred speech. He was unable to walk so stayed on 
the
ground.

EMS arrived and took him to ___ by 8:10. His NIHSS was 4 there
for -2 LOC, -1 left sensory, -1 aphasia. He had CT which showed
no hemorrhage and CTA which showed L ICA occlusion. He was given
tPA (total 73.6 mg) with bolus beginning at 8:47. He reportedly
worsened about 45 minutes later with right arm and face 
weakness.
It is unclear what his blood pressure was at that time. However,
after being flat with fluids he improved to NIHSS 3. He was
transferred to ___.

On arrival to ___ he just reports mild left frontal headache.
He is still having resolving numbness of left face and left arm.
He does not feel weak at all and notices only mild issue with
naming.

dissection.

C1 ICA with
associated T1 eccentric mural hyperintense signal compatible

Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ hx of HLD who presents as a transfer from ___ after 
presenting with aphasia and right arm weakness.

#acute ischemic stroke:
#ICA dissection
CTA head and neck at ___ demonstrated a left frontotemporal lobe 
infarct and right ICA occlusion. He received TPA at 08:47 on 
___, and then was transferred to ___ for further management. 
He was initially admitted to the neuro ICU for observation, then 
transferred to ___ after 24 hours of clinical stability. MRA of 
the neck with fat sat showed left ICA dissection, which is the 
likely source of embolism underlying his stroke. Carotid 
ultrasound corroborated this finding. The patient reported that 
he had recently been in a jetski trip, during which he sustained 
a whiplash injury which was thought to be the mechanism of 
dissection. The patient's aphasia and right arm arm weakness 
gradually improved. The patient's hospitalization was 
complicated by episodes of right gaze deviation with right 
facial numbness, which was thought to be secondary to seizure 
versus flow-dependent phenomenon, as the patient complained of 
the symptoms upon sitting up or standing. The patient was 
monitored on continuous continuous video EEG, which did not show 
any epileptiform discharges. His activity was liberalized, with 
no progression of symptoms with increased activity. The patient 
was eventually started on apixaban 5mg PO BID prior to 
discharge, with a plan for continuation for at least 3 months, 
and determination of therapy duration to be decided at stroke 
follow up appointment with Dr. ___. Transitioned home 
simvastatin 10 mg to atorvastatin 40 mg QHS given elevated LDL 
at 117, though atherosclerosis was not thought to be the 
causative mechanism of stroke in this case.

MEDICATION CHANGES
- Started apixaban 5 mg BID
- Transitioned home simvastatin 10 mg to atorvastatin 40 mg QHS.

Transitional issues
[] Continue apixaban for at least 3 months. Final duration of 
therapy to determined on follow up.
[] Please continue to monitor patient's cholesterol.
[] Please continue to evaluate any further episodes of right 
gaze deviation with associated right facial numbness. If these 
episodes continue and do not appear to be positional, then 
consider repeat outpatient EEG and/or empiric AED therapy for 
possible seizures.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of right arm weakness and 
speech difficulty resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:

-High cholesterol

We are changing your medications as follows:
- Starting apixaban 5 mg twice daily 
- Switched simvastatin 10 mg to atorvastatin 40 mg daily 

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
