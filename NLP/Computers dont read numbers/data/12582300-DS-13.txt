ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: ___ year old female with a past medical 
history significant for hypertension and peripheral neuropathy, 
who presents with increasing diarrhea. Became tachycardic and 
hypotensive in the emergency department. She was found to have 
ST depressions in the precordial leads on EKG. 
.  
# CORONARIES: Ms. ___ had no complaints of chest pain or 
shortness of breath during her hostpialization. Her initial EKG 
demonstrated diffuse T-wave inversions and mild ST depression (~ 
0.___epression in the precordial leads). Although her 
initial troponins in the ED were < .01, her EKG changes were 
concerning for an acute coronary syndrome. Because of her strong 
risk factors (smoking history, hypertension) for ACS, she was 
started on a baby aspirin. She was admitted overnight to r/o MI. 
On hospital day 2, her serial troponins remained negative. Her 
lipid panel and HgbA1c were as follows: Chol 157 ___ 75 HDL 85 
LDL 57. She was not started on a statin during her 
hospitalization. Because the patient had consumed caffeine on 
the morning of discharged, we decided to complete a 
pharmacologic stress test as an outpatient. We recommended 
follow-up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient, if her stress test 
returned back positive.

# Tacyhcardia: In the ED, she had several episodes of SVT and 
had a short run of V Tach. She received 2 L of normal saline in 
the ED. She converted spontaneously into normal sinus rhythm. 
She had one episode of atrial tachycardia on the inpatient 
floor. Her tachycardia was mostly likely related to volume 
depletion after weeks of diarrhea. During her hospitalization, 
we held her dose of lasix and recommend 
.  
# Diarrhea: H/x of lymphocytic colitis. Stools were nonbloody. 
She had no fevers or leukocytosis since admission. Lactate was 
1.6. her diarrhea resolved overnight. She had been started on 
entacort 3mg tid.  C. diff and stool studies were unable to be 
completed since the patient's diarrhea resolved overnight. 
.  
# Urinary Tract infection: U/A in the ED revealed 13 WBCs, mod 
leukocytes, and many bacteria. She received 1 dose of 
ciprofloxacin 400mg IV in the ED. She was continued on

dysuria on admission, but the plan was to treat with a three day 
course of antibiotics.
