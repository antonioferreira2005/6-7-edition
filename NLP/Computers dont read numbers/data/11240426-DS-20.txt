Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with HIV on HAART, Afib on
coumadin, HTN, CKD, metastatic castration-resistant prostate
cancer s/p prostatectomy and radiation, now on C3D1 docetaxel
___ with bony metastases, who was admitted from ___ to inaptient ___ after presenting with shortness
of breath (77% on RA) and lower extremity edema, found to have
acute respiratory failure ___ multifocal pneumonia, who was 
noted
to have wide complex tachycardia started on amiodarone drip,
transferred to ___ cardiology service for further evaluation. 

Patient's hospitalization was notable for initial complaint of
dyspnea on exertion, cough and low grade fevers/chills for a few
weeks, with dizziness/lightheadedness when standing, poor
appetite, which he thought was also chemotherapy related. In the
ED, CT chest showed multilobar ground glass opacities with 
repeat
showing multifocal patchy opacities. Initially covered with 
broad
spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin,
Bactrim, transitioned to Levofloxacin and Bactrim per ID
recommendations, switched back to cefepime, doxycycline and
Bactrim due to concern for QTc prolongation. Was also started on
voriconazole and caspofungin for positive sputum culture growing
___ and slightly elevated galactomannan. Beta Glucan swab
negative. Patient was treated for likely fungal infection (+/-
bacterial) vs chemotherapy related pulmonary toxicity. He had a
bronchoscopy ___ for further evaluation, cultures pending. 

He was incidentally noted to have a stable wide complex
tachycardia on ___. Cardiology was consulted who felt this was
likely slow ventricular tachycardia. The episode resolved 
without
intervention. He was bolused 150 mg IV amiodarone and started on
an amiodarone drip. He shortly reverted back to his baseline
narrow complex atrial fibrillation. On ___ he became 
tachycardic
again to 100, remained asymptomatic and HDS. Cardiology was
called and advised re-bolusing with 150 mg x1 and increasing his
drip to 1 mg/min (had just been decreased per protocol).
Recommended transfer for EP evaluation. Troponin was elevated to
0.016 with nonischemic EKG.

On the floor, patient is feeling alright. His shortness of 
breath
is better but he hasn't been out of bed much. He has
tremulousness of his voice which he attributes to his tongue
being dry. He denies chest pain, ___ swelling, palpitations,
abdominal pain, headaches.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted from ___ to inpatient 
___ after presenting with shortness of breath, hypoxia (77% on 
RA), and lower extremity edema. Found to have acute respiratory 
failure ___ multifocal pneumonia. Was noted to have wide complex 
tachycardia started on amiodarone drip, transferred to ___ 
cardiology and found to have atrial fibrillation with aberrancy, 
transferred to medicine for further treatment of multifocal 
pneumonia.  

ACTIVE ISSUES:  
===============  
# Atrial fibrillation with aberrancy:
S/p amiodarone at ___ d/t concern for VT. Amiodarone
dc'd on admission after EP consult confirmed atrial fibrillation
with aberrancy. Subtherapeutic on warfarin (INR 1.7) on 
admission
with history of difficult to control INR. From patient history,
afib sounds very difficult to cardiovert (s/p multiple 
electrical
and chemical cardioversions) but concern for possible
cardioversion on amiodarone, so started on heparin bridge to
therapeutic INR. Following discussions with his outpatient 
oncologist and PCP switched to ___ given h/o difficult to 
control INR. Was switched from atenolol to metoprolol for rate 
control given considerable drug interactions of atenolol with 
antibiotics and antifungals. Uptitrated to metoprolol XL 50 mg 
qd on discharge. 

# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure:
# Multifocal Pneumonia:
Immunocompromised (HIV on HART, docetaxel for prostate cancer).
Presented with shortness of breath, cough, hypoxia, multifocal
patchy opacities, thought most likely atypical vs fungal vs
chemotherapy-associated toxicity. Flu negative. Positive sputum
culture growing ___ and slightly elevated galactomannan, 
Beta
Glucan swab negative. S/p Bronch ___ with cultures negative.
Sputum viral panel negative. Transferred on cefepime,
doxycycline, and Bactrim + voriconazole and caspofungin. Had
trialed steroids but not helpful. ID and pulmonary were 
consulted
at ___ reconsulted at ___. Per ID recs, Bactrim
d/ced w/ negative PCP and voriconazole + caspo d/ced as low
suspicion for fungal origin given patient CD4+. Patient 
completed regimen of doxycycline/Cefepime on ___. Patient was 
weaned off O2 throughout stay and was recommended to be 
discharged to rehab. Patient may still require O2 with 
ambulation, as he can desaturation into ___ on room air. Expect 
improvement with continued recovery from PNA, however if he does 
not improve may need further imaging in a few weeks. Of note, 
his baseline SpO2 outpatient was 96-99% resting on room air.

# HTN:
SBPs were on the higher side up to 150s-160s, possibly in part 
due to the atenolol switch to metoprolol. BP was monitored and a 
dose of amlodipine 2.5mg was administered. Further uptitration 
as outpatient is recommended. 

# Anemia:
Patient noted to have notable drop from baseline Hct/Hbg since
___, though is chronically anemic and on chemo. MCV was normal 
to
high, potentially expected with antiretroviral he is on. Though
LDH is elevated, TBili is normal and so hemolytic causes were 
deemed
unlikely. Nutritional causes were considered in setting of poor 
appetite. Was found to have low iron with elevated ferritin, low 
TIBC and transferrin. Folate and B12 normal. Likely c/w anemia 
of chronic disease.

CHRONIC ISSUES 
==============
# HIV:
VL not detected ___. CD4 - 468 on ___. His antivirals (Triumeq 
1 tab daily, Rilpivirine 25 mg) were continued. It was also 
determined there was no known interaction between rilpivirine 
and the ___.

# CKD:
Stable. Baseline Cr around 1.5 per records, on OSH admission 1.2 
and remained stable around 0.9 afterwards until discharge. 

# Metastatic prostate cancer:
# s/p prostatectomy and radiation therapy: 
Stable. On Docetaxel Q3W, has finished Cycle 3, Dr. ___ 
is
outpatient Heme/onc. Continued home prednisone and Lupron depot 
Q3M 

# Hyperlipidemia:
Stable. Continued home Lipitor.

# Depression:
Stable. Continued home Wellbutrin and imipramine. 

Transitional issues 
===================
[] Started ___ 5mg BID as switch from warfarin. 
[] Started metoprolol succinate 50 mg switched from atenolol. 
F/u rate control.
[] Needs an outpatient cardiologist to manage atrial 
fibrillation with aberrancy.
[] Completed 10-day course with doxycycline/Cefepime (last dose 
= ___ for multifocal PNA.
[] Started on amlodipine 2.5 qd given SBPs 150s-160s. Please 
monitor BP and uptitrate accordingly. 
[] Did not resume home potassium on discharge given stable 
potassium levels around 4.0 during hospital stay. Please obtain 
repeat BMP w/in 1 week to ensure stable potassium. 
[] Based on ___ records, resting SpO2 96-99% on room air. 
Here, resting SpO2 low ___ on room air with desaturation to 
___ with activity. When on 2L NC low ___ with ambulation. 
Please continue to provide oxygen to patient while ambulating 
and wean as tolerated. 
[] If SpO2 does not improve within a few weeks as 
pneumonia/atelectasis resolve, please repeat imaging CXR vs. CT.
[] Please provide patient with incentive spirometer to 
prevent/improve atelectasis.
