History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with history of dementia who presents after 
fall with neck pain. At approximately 10am, the patient was 
found on the ground after fall from the standing position in the 
bathroom. It was not known how long she was down. The patient 
was found to be ambulatory on the scene, but about four hours 
later began to complain of neck and right hip pain. She had a 
portable x-ray performed which was concerning for a possible 
C4-5 fracture. The patient was immobilized and brought in via 
EMS. The patient denies numbness, tingling or weakness in any of 
her extremities. She denies saddle anesthesia, bowel/bladder 
incontinence, and denies pain anywhere.  

In the ED, initial vital signs were 98, 68, 197/75, 16, 100% RA. 
Labs demonstrated a mild leukocytosis to 15.8k, unremarkable 
chem-7, and mildly elevated CK 496. A UA had small 
leukoesterase, 6 WBC, and few bacteria. A CT C-spine 
demonstrated spinous process fractures of C2 through C6. A CXR, 
XR hip, and CT head were without acute process.  
The patient was seen by Spine who recommended immobility and MRI 
to further assess the fractures; they had no concern for acute 
neurologic involvement.
On the floor, the patient denies pain and is in no acute 
distress.

STUDIES:
===========================
CT C-SPINE (___)
Spinous process fractures from C2 through C6. Further imaging 
with MRI is recommended to evaluate for additional ligamentous 
injury.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (___)
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality. 
2. Periapical lucency surrounding a posterior left maxillary 
tooth. 

PELVIC XR (___)
No fracture or dislocation. Mild degenerative changes in the 
hips.

CXR (___)
No acute intrathoracic process.

ECHO (___)
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size 
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>65%). Tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, 
laterally directed jet of mild to moderate (___) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity 
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. 
Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. 
Increased PCWP. 

MRI C-SPINE
1. Interspinous soft tissue edema in association with the 
previously described C2 through C6 fractures without evidence of 
ligamentum flavum disruption. Presumably, the anterior portion 
of the interspinous ligaments are intact. 
2. Increased T2/STIR signal within the T1 and T2 vertebral 
bodies could represent nondisplaced acute or subacute fractures 
although there is no evidence of retropulsion or spinal canal 
narrowing. 
3. No evidence of epidural hematoma or spinal cord compression. 
4. Multilevel cervical spondylosis, greatest at the C3-C4 and 
C4-C5 levels, as described. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of dementia who presents from nursing home 
after fall from standing, and found to have multiple cervical 
spinal process fractures, admitted for further evaluation and 
management.  

# CERVICAL SPINOUS PROCESS FRACTURES: The patient was found to 
have fractures of multiple spinous processes without loss of 
vertebral height or displacement. MRI C-spine confirmed 
fractures without disruption of ligaments. She did not have any 
neurologic deficits. Ortho-Spine recommended non-surgical 
management. She will need to wear a ___ J collar at all times 
for ___ weeks. Her pain was controlled with standing Tylenol and 
Tramadol PRN. She will follow up with Ortho-Spine in ___ weeks 
after discharge. 
 
# FALL VERSUS SYNCOPE: The patient reportedly fell from standing 
position while in the bathroom. As the patient was unable to 
provide an accurate history, it is unclear if this was a 
mechanical fall or syncopal episode. Telemetry was notable for 
sinus bradycardia (HR ___. She also had prolonging P-P 
intervals, long PR intervals with occasional 2nd degree type 1 
AV block and intermittent high-grade AV block with pauses as 
long as 7s. The pauses only occurred in the early morning. These 
findings are most consistent with increased vagal tone. It was 
reasoned that these pauses occurred while the patient was 
sleeping as she had no further pauses during the daytime. Her 
heart rate increased appropriately when she worked with physical 
therapy.  She was evaluated by EP and they did NOT recommend PPM 
placement.  Echocardiogram was notable for mild AS, which is 
likely insufficient to cause syncope. Due to concerns for 
hypotension, nifedipine was discontinued. She was started on 
lisinopril, which may be uptitrated as an outpatient. 

# HYPERTENSION: Nifedipine was held during admission due to 
concern for hypotension causing syncope. Due to elevated blood 
pressures, she was started on lisinopril, which may be 
uptitrated as an outpatient.
  
# DEMENTIA:  Per son, the patient has mild cognitive impairment, 
which worsened 6 months ago. Despite dementia, she is quite 
functional and lives in an assisted living facility. During this 
admission she was oriented to name, and occasionally to place. 
She was continued on donepezil. Delirium precautions were 
continued. 

# CAD: She was continued on home aspirin.

# GERD: Continued home omeprazole.

# Depression: Continue home paroxetine.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted after a fall. You were found 
to have fractures of several bones in your neck. The orthopedic 
spine doctors saw ___, and recommend you wear a neck brace for 
the next ___ weeks. We monitored your heart rhythm during your 
hospitalization. The cardiac monitor showed pauses, though these 
occurred while you were sleeping and likely did not contribute 
to your fall. We are glad you are feeling better and we wish you 
the best.
