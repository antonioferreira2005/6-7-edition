History of Present Illness:
___ year old female with h/o renal tx in ___ who initially 
presented to an OSH ED with complaints of right flank pain that 
began last night.  She was treated emperically with Zosyn for a 
UTI and was subsequently transferred to ___. In the ___ ED, 
a renal US was obtained and this was significant for severe 
hydronephrosis, increased from ___. Her creatinine was 1.4 
(baseline ~1.3). Patient described her pain as being sharp and 
intermittent, radiating from her flank to her groin. She felt 
similar pain last ___ when she was admitted to ___ and 
diagnosed with UTI.  When she was seen in the ED, her pain was 
___. She denies any difficulty with urination and feels that 
she completely empties her bladder. Patient does endorse urinary 
frequency. Also complained of nausea and vomiting last night, 
but none today. 

Per report, a CT scan was obtained at the OSH that was negative 
for ureteral stone, but was consistent cholecystitis, and 
possible cystitis. 

In the ED here, initial vs were: 03:13 (unable) 98.6 72 ___ 99%. Labs were remarkable for creatinine of 1.4 (baseline 
1.3), UA with few bacteria and moderate leuks, but <1 WBC. 
Ultrasound of her renal transplant was notable for 
hydronephrosis. RUQ U/S was negative. She was given her 
immunosuppressants and antihypertensive medications. Foley 
catheter was placed and renal ultrasound s/p placement showed 
some improvement of hydronephrosis. Her pain improved, and she 
threatened to leave AMA. She was seen by both urology and 
transplant surgery, who felt that she should be admitted to 
medicine for monitoring. 
  
On the floor, she complains of some numbness over her 
transplanted kidney, but denies any additional pain.

although significantly worsened from ___, suggesting 
ureteral obstruction.   2.  Patent renal arteries with normal 
waveforms.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with h/o renal tx in ___ who initially 
presented to an OSH ED with complaints of right flank pain for 1 
day. 

# Pyelnephritis: Patient presented with one day of pain over her 
transplant and numbness in this area as well. No fevers, chills, 
urinary symptoms. UA on presentaiton to the ED was not terribly 
impressive, and urine culture was consistent with skin flora. 
However, at OSH she had a CT abd/pel and report showed stranding 
around transplant and bladder, suggestive of pyelonephritis. 
Ultrasound of the transplanted kidney showed hydronephrosis 
which was somewhat improved after placement of a Foley cathter. 
Foley was left in place for decompression and she was 
empirically treated with ceftriaxone for pyelo. Following 
removal of the foley she was able to void normally, and her 
post-void residual was 12cc. She was treated with a total of 14 
days of antibiotics. She will see her outpaient renal team for 
follow-up. 

# Nausea/Vomiting: Had episodes of N/V over the weekend prior to 
admission, but no additional episodes during this 
hospitalization. She denies any dysphagia, but had a prior 
episode of ___ esophagitis in the ___. She may 
benefit from additional GI follow-up as an outpatient and 
consideration of EGD for additional evaluation if N/V returns or 
dysphagia develops. 
 
# Renal transplant: Patient is s/p transplant in ___ from 
living donor (sister). She was continued on MMF and rapamycin 
for immunosuppression. Her creatinine remained at her baseline 
during this admission.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Hypertension: Continued diltiazem, lisinopril   

# Dillusional disorder, paranoia: Patient with prior deac 4 
admission for paranoia. She had previously been on risperidone 
but is no longer taking this. In the past she has felt that her 
sister (kidney donor) and mother are stalking her and 
impersonating her online, poisoning her and attempting to 
control her. This delusion was persistent during this admission, 
and psych and social work were consulted. Per their assessment 
she was safe for discharge home. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
- She may benefit from additional GI follow-up as an outpatient 
and consideration of EGD for additional evaluation if N/V 
returns or dysphagia develops. 
- Given extent of delusional thinking she would likely benefit 
from outpatient psych follow-up, but she was not agreeable to 
this plan at the time of discharge. 
- Blood cultures pending at the time of discharge
