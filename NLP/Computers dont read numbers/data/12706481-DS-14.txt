History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is ___ RHW with PMH of HLD and borderline HTN who 
presented to OSH after her husband found her lying on the floor 
in their living room window and and CT scan at ___ demonstrated 
a large R parietal/occipital IPH and R parietal SAH. She was 
transferred to ___ for further managment of these bleeds. On 
arrival at ___, her BP was 200/99. She was given labelatol 10mg 
IV x2 as well as mannitol 50g IV x1 given vasogenic edema. On 
transfer here, she was also loaded with dilantin and started on 
Nicardipine drip for BP control. Of note, Cr was found to be 
1.9, up from baseline of 0.7 ___ years ago.  

Initially admitted to the neurosurgery service for management of 
intracranial hemorrhages, but transferred to neurology. 

Ms. ___ stated that she has had a headache for the last 5 
days, since ___ at noon. When it started, patient was eating 
lunch. The headache started gradually, reaching peak intensity 
of ___ after several hours. She did not have any confusion, 
visual disturbances, nausea, weakness with the headache. The 
pain was localized to the right temple. Day prior to admission, 
the pain was so severe that she vomited after eating.  Pain was 
somewhat relieved by massaging right temple. She took advil, but 
that did not alleviate the pain very much. Ms. ___ stated she 
slept on the couch yesterday evening and upon awakening "had 
difficulty positioning the legs to stand up." Denies any focal 
weakness in arms or legs, says "more of a problem with 
positioning."  Denies difficulty with speech, comprehension. 
Denies any changes in vision, double vision, black spots. She 
does not regularly get many headaches.  No night sweats. No 
changes in weight, no joint pain, no rash. No fecal/urinary 
incontience, no dysuria. No herbal supplements.  No known 
history of malignancy, thought did have a tubular adenoma on 
colonoscopy in ___.  Currently, she does not have a headache.  
She denies any difficulty with her vision on initial 
questioning, but does notice she cannot see
well when she is unable to answer what color eyes examiner has, 
etc. Patient states that she goes to her PCP ___. 

However, per Atrius records, she was last seen ___ years ago. At 
that time, SBP was 136. She was asked to return for close blood 
pressure monitoring but has cancelled multiple appointments 
since. 

Of note, Patient's husband gives a somewhat different account of 
yesterday's events.  He states that he came home at 7pm and saw 
Ms. ___ lying on the floor with face down, eyes closed. Her 
face was puffy. He yelled her name, she tried to open her eyes 
but was unable to initially.  She was having difficulty moving 
her left arm and leg. She was understanding everything he said 
to her. She was able to speak, but not well--slow, not sure if 
she was slurring speech. Ms. ___ was quite "groggy" at that 
time. After 30 min, husband called her sister and then called 
ambulance.

================================
NEURO-IMAGING:
___ OSH: 
1.  Parenchymal hemorrhage within the right cerebral hemisphere 
with surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect with leftward 
shift of normally midline structures (10 mm shift). 
2.  Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
3.  Possible uncal herniation cannot be excluded. 
4.  Hypodensity within the left parieto-occipital, left frontal 
and right 
frontal regions of unclear etiology. Unclear if patient has some 
underlying disease or brain metastases that have hemorrhaged. An 
MRI may be obtained for further evaluation. 
 
___ ___: (2 HRS after the OSH imaging)
1.  Right cerebral parenchymal hemorrhage and surrounding 
vasogenic edema, 11 mm leftward shift of normally midline 
structures (previously 10 mm at a comparable level), bilateral 
subarachnoid hemorrhage  
2.  Hypodense areas within the right parieto-occipital, right 
and left frontal regions. 
ATTENDING NOTE: No change in mass effect or hemorrhage.  

___ CTA head/neck:
1.  Stable appearance of right parietal and frontal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage and bilateral subarachnoid 
hemorrhage. 
2.  Hypodensities in the bilateral frontal and occipital lobes 
are noted likely representing edema.  Differential diagnosis 
includes PRES with hemorrhagic conversion; however, underlying 
mass is not completely excluded. If there is concern for 
underlying metastasis MRI could be useful for further 
evaluation. 
3.  No abnormal vascular structures, arterial venous 
malformation or enhancing mass lesions are seen. 

___ MRI/MRV:
Multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhages in the right parietal 
and occipital lobes, with additional foci of vasogenic edema in 
the bilateral cerebral hemispheres and in the left cerebellum.  
Findings could represent PRES with hemorrhage versus  venous 
infarcts, although the lack of visualization of the left 
transverse sinus could be related to a hypoplastic sinus rather 
than venous sinus thrombosis. 

___ TTE: 
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF 65%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic 
valve is bicuspid. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion.

___ RENAL U/S: Normal gray-scale, color, and spectral 
Doppler evaluation of the kidneys bilaterally.

___ LUE/LLE ultrasound: Deep vein thrombosis in one of the 
left paired brachial veins as well as the left cephalic vein. No 
evidence of left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.

___ Blood culture ___ bottles positive for coag negative 
staph
___ Blood culture no growth to date
 
Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] Blood pressure control, patient on multiple medications. 
Would like to uptitrate lisinopril and wean off clonidine if 
possible
[] Plan for renal biopsy, will likely need to be scheduled as 
outpatient (___)
[] LUE PICC associated DVT, held off on systemic anticoagulation 
given recent intraparenchymal hemorrhages, but will need lovenox 
prophylaxis x2 weeks and may require follow up ultrasound in few 
weeks to re-evaluate.

Ms. ___ is ___ RHW with PMH of HLD and borderline HTN who 
presented to OSH after her husband found her lying on the floor 
in their living room window and and CT scan there demonstrated a 
large R parietal/occipital IPH and R parietal SAH with posterior 
white matter changes, consistent with PRES. Her hospital course 
complicated by difficult to control blood pressure and catheter 
associated LUE DVT.

# Neuro: Patient with initial left sided weakness, L visual 
field deficit and hemineglect as well. Patient also complained 
of headaches while in the ICU, which improved with blood 
pressure control. She was started on Keppra for seizure 
prophylaxis, given that she was found down in house and it was 
unclear whether or not she had a seizure at home. Patient did 
not have a clinical seizure in the hospital. Her blood pressure 
goal was SBP 110-160, and she required nicardipine gtt in the 
ICU. She was started on labetalol, amlodipine and clonidine and 
was able to be weaned off nicardipine. After she was transferred 
to the floor, she required IV hydralazine ___ times daily due to 
elevated blood pressures. Lisinopril was added for better blood 
pressure control and also for her nephrotic syndrome (as below). 


# CV: No history of cardiac problems, though her last PCP ___ 
___ years ago document SBP of 130s. Patient reports that her 
blood pressure has been "normal" prior to this. TTE with mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal LVEF (65%). 
Patient's hypertension was difficult to control and required 
multiple medications as above. Also, her LDL was elevated to 
288, so she was started on 80 mg of atorvastatin. 

# Renal: No history of kidney problems in the past, patient with 
Cr of 1.8 on presentation and nephrotic syndrome with edema and 
proteinuria. Patient did report that she had swelling in her 
legs and foamy urine for a few months, during this ___. Her 
blood pressure was controlled with medications as above and her 
creatinine improved. Her initial work up for nephrotic syndrome 
had negative HIV, ___, hepatitis panel. Her C3/C4 were within 
normal limits. SPEP did not show any specific abnormalities and 
UPEP showed predominant albumin but negative for ___ 
protein, and no monoclonal immunoglobulin. Renal was planning 
for kidney biopsy but it was deferred because of her labile 
blood pressure. It will likely need to be scheduled as 
outpatient.

# ID: Patient had initial leukocytosis, and infectious work up 
was done but negative. She did have positive coag neg staph in 
blood culture, and received vancomycin for a few days, but as it 
was only 1 out of 2 bottles, and subsequent BCx negative to 
date, it was thought to be due to contamination. Her 
leukocytosis resolved and patient remained afebrile. 

# HEME: She had one day of thrombocytopenia, but resolved on its 
own. Her CBC was monitored and leukocytosis resolved as above. 
Patient developed a PICC associated LUE DVT, no DVT seen in LLE. 
So her LUE PICC was discontinued and her DVT prophylaxis was 
changed to lovenox 30 BID. Further systemic anticoagulation was 
not started given her recent multiple intraparenchymal 
hemorrhages. 

# ENDO: A1C of 5.7%, no insulin needed.
# FEN: heart healthy diet, replete lytes prn, no IVF
# PPx: SQ lovenox and pneumoboots for prophylaxis. Bowel reg 
with senna/colace  
# Code status: Full Code
