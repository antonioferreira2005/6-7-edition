IMAGING:
========
___ Toe Xray:
uestionable new fracture of the medial aspect of the proximal 
had of the
distal phalanx is demonstrated, not clearly seen on previous 
examination.  No
associated soft tissue swelling is seen.  Overall there is 
decreased bone
density compared to previous examination from ___. 
If concern for
osteomyelitis is present, assessment with MRI is to be 
considered.

___ CTA Chest:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality 
although
examination is somewhat limited by motion.
2. Extensive areas of consolidation with associated moderate 
right and small
left pleural effusions.  Findings can represent multifocal 
pneumonia versus
asymmetric pulmonary edema.
3. Moderate right, small left pleural effusions.
 
CXR ___:
The tip of the endotracheal tube projects at the level of the 
clavicular
heads.  A feeding tube extends to the stomach and the tip of an 
esophageal
probe projects over the GE junction.  The tip of a right 
internal jugular
central venous catheter projects over the cavoatrial junction.
 
Unchanged opacifications are noted throughout the right lung and 
left lung base consistent with multifocal pneumonia.  No 
pneumothorax.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are also 
suspected.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.

Renal US ___:
1. No hydronephrosis.  Simple right renal cyst.
2. Scant trace ascites incidentally noted ___ the pelvis.

EEG ___:
This is an abnormal video-EEG monitoring session because of
diffuse background slowing and disorganization. This is 
indicative of
moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is 
nonspecific as to etiology. Common causes are infection, toxic 
and metabolic abnormalities, and medication effects. There were 
also rare generalized epileptiform discharges, which is 
indicative of increased predispositions to generalized seizures. 
This recording captured no pushbutton activations or 
electrographic seizures. Compared to the prior day's recording, 
there is mild improvement ___ the background activity and less 
frequent generalized sharp wave discharges.

CXR ___:
Comparison to ___.  The patient is rotated.  Moderate 
cardiomegaly persists.  Stable appearance of the lung 
parenchymal changes.  No new opacities.  Stable position of the 
right internal jugular vein catheter.

antibiotics, course complicated by multifocal pneumonia and 
respiratory and PEA arrest on ___, status post targeted 
temperature management.

ACUTE ISSUES:
-------------
# Laminectomy wound dehiscence & infection
Patient presented with dehisced surgical wound from laminectomy, 
underwent I&D and closure. Wound swabs grew MSSA, ID consulted 
was ultimately coursed out for 6 weeks of cefepime and Flagyl 
ending ___.

# Hypoxemic respiratory failure
# Multifocal pneumonia
# Diffuse pulmonary edema
Hospital course, complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure, 
respiratory arrest requiring intubation and PEA arrest requiring 
resuscitation. He was extubated the next day and imaging showed 
bilateral extensive infiltrates concerning for multifocal 
pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis. He also has 
significant pulmonary edema. Respiratory status improved 
markedly with antibiotic therapy and auto diuresis coupled with 
pharmacologic diuresis. He completed an 8 day course for 
hospital-acquired pneumonia ending ___. He was on room air at 
time of discharge breathing comfortably.

# Cardiac Arrest
Patient had respiratory arrest and PEA arrest on ___. He 
received 8 minutes of chest compressions before ROSC. TTE showed 
hypokinesis of the RCA territory, EF55%. He underwent targeted 
temperature management, no focal neurologic deficits were noted 
thereafter and no neuroimaging was pursued. Troponin peaked at 
0.51. No acute ischemic EKG changes were ever noted. Thereafter 
he was optimized medically.

# T2DM
# Hyperglycemia
While on tube feeds at this blood sugar ranged from 200-400 
despite significant insulin. After discontinuing tube feeds 
course complicated by a couple episodes of minimally symptomatic 
hypoglycemia ___ the ___, owing mostly to poor p.o. intake with 
fluctuating appetite. He was discharged on home oral 
anti-hyperglycemics but no insulin.

# Wound on right great toe
# PVD
Recently (___) evaluated by podiatry and vascular surgery and 
ultimately underwent right SFA and proximal peroneal stenting. 
He does have a history of cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Notably 
CHA ED and imaging concerning for erosions perhaps related to 
osteomyelitis. Patient and family declined amputation and bone 
biopsy as recommended by podiatry. He is undergoing long term IV 
antibiotic treatment for MSSA infection of surgical wound as 
above. He was discharged on Plavix and ___, with lifelong 
aspirin thereafter. Wound recs as noted below.

# Nutrition
After arrest was aspirating, for a period of time was maintained 
on tube feeds through ___. After passing further speech and 
swallow test she was transitioned to p.o. Intake was poor but 
adequate related more to disliking the hospital food.

# Hypertension
Presented ___ shock ___ setting of infection, cardiac arrest. Was 
gradually restarted on home medications thereafter.

# Anemia
Postoperatively had blood loss, ultimately required 1 unit PRBC. 
thereafter had gradual recovery of blood counts. Discharge 
hemoglobin approximately 9.

# ___
Baseline creatinine 1.2, peaked at 3.7, downtrended with 
diuresis, discharge Cr 1.3.
