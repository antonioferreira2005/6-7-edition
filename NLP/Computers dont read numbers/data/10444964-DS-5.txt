Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy complicated 
by a postoperative hypotension requiring pressors and suspected 
subfsacial hematoma in the recovery room requiring 
re-exploration in the operating room, 3 units of packed red 
blood cells transfusion for an intraoperative Hct of 20.6, 
re-sewing of the vaginal cuff, and cystoscopy.  She was found to

right cardinal ligament. Please see the operative reports for 
full details.  She remained hemodynamically stable with a stable 
hematocrit and normal vital signs throughout the remainder of 
her hospital course.  

Her postoperative course was complicated by complaints of chest 
pain in the recovery room following her second procedure, and 
EKG was negative and cardiac enzymes were negative on 2 serial 
checks.  This pain spontaneously resolved, and it was not felt

infection or cellulitis.  On postoperative day 1 she was slow to 
advance her diet, and she was found to be hypokalemic to a K of
