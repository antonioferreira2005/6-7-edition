Brief Hospital Course:
Outpatient Providers: TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
#G tube:
[ ] Keep G tube to gravity during the day. Please connect to 
suction for 1 hour three times throughout the day, and as needed 
for bloating/nausea. 
[ ] Please cap G tube for 1 hour following medications by mouth
[ ] Patient will follow-up with Interventional Radiology for 
monitoring and management of G-J tube.
[ ] If your G tube starts to have bloody output, please stop 
your apixaban and call your oncologist.

#Nutrition:
[ ] Please try to keep the tube feeds on for as long as possible 
throughout the day (at least 12 hours). If you feel that you are 
doing ok and can try a little more, let your visiting nurse 
know, and the rate of the tube feeds can be increased. Your goal 
tube feed rate is 45 ml/hr for 24 hours. 
[] Please try to take in as many liquids as possible, such as 
juice, popsicles, or broth. Please avoid caffeinated or 
carbonated beverages, and alcohol.

# Pulmonary Embolism 
[ ] Continue apixaban 5mg twice a day (we considered switching 
to Lovenox, but you were able to tolerate pills again by the end 
of the hospitalization.) If your G tube starts bleeding, hold 
the apixaban and call your oncologist. 

# Depression:
[ ] Continue sertraline at 50mg per day until you see a doctor 
in clinic and have an EKG to check your QTc interval. If it is 
stable, you can talk to your doctor about going back up to your 
100mg dose.
