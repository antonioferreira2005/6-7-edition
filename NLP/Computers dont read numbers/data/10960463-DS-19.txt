==========================
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS ___. Extensive intraperitoneal metastasis appears similar to ___.  No new mass is identified. 
2. 1.9 cm area of hypoenhancement is identified in the upper 
pole of left 
kidney.  Please clinically correlate for any pyelonephritis. 

CT CHEST ___
Increasing left-sided pleural effusion, now moderate in size 
with substantial left lower lobe atelectasis.  Trace new 
right-sided pleural effusion. 

CXR ___
Pigtail catheter has been discontinued.  Left pleural effusion 
is small, 
unchanged.  Minimal left apical pneumothorax is unchanged.  
Right pleural 
effusion is small to moderate.  Atelectasis in the right lung 
base is 
unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 

CTAP ___:
1. Predominantly stable peritoneal and omental metastases.  2 
peritoneal 
nodules in the right lower quadrant are slightly decreased in 
size.  The 
conglomerate mass in the pelvis is slightly decreased in size, 
it compresses 
the sigmoid colon however there is no evidence of colonic 
obstruction.  Please 
note that tumor infiltration into the sigmoid colon cannot be 
excluded. 
2. New right moderate pleural effusion, small to moderate left 
pleural 
effusion is slightly decreased in size 
3. Small amount of ascites decreased from prior study

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ yo woman with recent diagnosis of stage IV high 
grade serous ovarian CA who presented with diarrhea and BRBPR, 
found to have partial bowel obstruction from sigmoid mass and as 
well as malignant pleural effusion and ascites. 

#Partial bowel obstruction
Underwent flex sigmoidoscopy on ___ which demonstrated friable 
distal sigmoid mass with extrinsic compression of the rectum and 
sigmoid colon from a pelvic mass. Her diarrhea was thus felt to 
represent overflow incontinence in the setting of partial distal 
obstruction. She was managed here conservatively with a course 
notable for difficult to manage symptoms oscillating between 
obstruction symptoms and fecal incontinence. For her fecal 
incontinence, we considered placing a flexiseal but this was 
deferred in the setting of distal sigmoid mass. A palliative 
sigmoid stent was also considered but the ERCP team felt it was 
unlikely to stay in place due to extrinsic compression. She is 
not a good candidate for diverting colostomy per surgery. 
Loperamide 2mg once a day calmed her symptoms when they were 
particularly unbearable (she was sensitive to this medication 
and higher doses worsened her obstructive symptoms). She 
continued to have intermittent bleeding from her sigmoid mass, 
which manifested as some mild BRBPR requiring 2 blood 
transfusions. On discharge, she was in manageable place with 
regards to her symptoms. The hope is that ongoing chemo will 
provide further support by decreasing disease burden. She 
received cycle 2 ___ in house (___). 

#High grader serous ovarian cancer
Carboplatin C1D1 on ___, C2 carboplatin/taxol (___). 
Both cycles were well tolerated.

#Urinary frequency
Ms. ___ had urinary frequency likely from tumor compression on 
her bladder on top of her chronic urge incontinence. Her home 
oxybutynin was avoided in the setting of her partial bowel 
obstruction. A foley was placed for symptomatic relief but was 
ultimately removed given infection risk.

#Malignant pleural effusion with superinfection
Found to have an enlarging left pleural effusion on imaging. IP 
placed a chest tube with good effect. Cytology was positive for 
malignant cells consistent with her known ovarian cancer. Her 
pleural fluid culture grew out morganella, which was somewhat 
surprising given her lack of infectious symptoms. She completed 
a 2 week course of ciprofloxacin. Repeat CXR on ___ showed 
recurrence of bilateral pleural effusion but given absence of 
respiratory and infectious symptoms, repeat pleural tap was 
deferred. 

#Malignant ascites
Underwent therapeutic paracentesis by ___ on ___. Labs and 
culture were incompatible with SBP. 

#Leukocytosis
Likely reflects immune response to malignancy vs prednisone txt 
for rheumatoid arthritis. Her WBC returned to normal prior to 
discharge. 

#Rheumatoid arthritis
Continued prednisone 10 mg daily

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

WHY WAS I ADMITTED?
- You were admitted for management of a partial bowel 
obstruction related to your ovarian cancer. 

WHAT WAS DONE WHILE I WAS HERE?
-You underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy which showed a large 
malignant mass in your sigmoid colon. This mass and cancer 
spread elsewhere in your pelvis was the cause of your 
diarrhea/obstruction symptoms and bloody stools. Your symptoms 
were managed with medication, bowel rest, chemotherapy, and 
blood transfusions as required. 

-You started chemotherapy with carboplatin here on ___. You 
received a second cycle of chemotherapy on ___.

-You were found to have a large left lung effusion related to 
your cancer. A chest tube was placed for drainage. You completed 
a 14 day course of antibiotics for infection noted in your lung 
fluid fluid. 

-You underwent drainage of fluid accumulating in your abdomen. 

 
WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?
- You should take your medications as instructed
