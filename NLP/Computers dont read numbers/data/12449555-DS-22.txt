Pertinent Results:
___ CT ABD/PELVIS W&W/O CONTRAST
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Limited 
evaluation 
of the lung bases displays normal right lung with air and fluid 
noted within 
the visualized left lower hemithorax which displays enhancement 
of the pleura. 
Pneumobilia consistent with patient's known Whipple procedure is 
again 
present. The liver parenchyma is homogenous with no focal 
lesions and the 
portal venous system remains patent. Remaining pancreas, 
stomach, spleen, 
adrenal glands, and kidneys appear unremarkable without evidence 
of focal 
perfusion abnormalities or hydronephrosis. No pathologically 
enlarged lymph 
nodes or free air is noted within the abdominal cavity. Multiple 
surgical 
clips are noted and there is stable appearance to extensive 
atherosclerotic 
disease. 
  
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Air is 
noted within a 
Foley containing urinary bladder which displays multiple 
exophytic bladder 
diverticula along its anterior and lateral walls. The bladder 
wall itself 
appears irregular and displays hyperemia. In addition there is 
irregular 
enhancement noted along the thickended posterior left bladder 
wall which is 
subsequently with excreted IV contrast on more delayed images. 
The ureters 
appear unremarkable without any abnormal wall thickening or 
filling defects 
within. Remaining intrapelvic contents including uterus and 
bowel appear 
normal. 
  
BONE WINDOWS: No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are 
identified. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Irregular slightly thickened enhancing bladder wall with more 
focal mural 
irregularity noted along the posterior left surface. While this 
may represent 
underlying cystitis/fungal involvement, neoplasm cannot be 
excluded ___ CT and 
correlation with dedicated cystoscopy should be considered. 
Multiple bladder 
diverticula are again noted. The kidneys and ureters appear 
unremarkable. 
  
2. Expected pneumobilia status post Whipple with no evidence of 
definite 
local recurrence. 
  
3. Air and fluid within the visualized left lower hemithorax 
with pleural 
enhancement. While this may be post-operative, simlar findings 
are present 
with complex effusions such as empyema. Would consider 
correlation with fluid 
analysis. 
.
___ BLADDER U/S
FINDINGS: A Foley catheter was identified within the bladder. 
The bladder 
wall appears irregularly thickened. Along the posterior margin 
of the bladder 
wall, there is an intraluminal mixed echogenicity irregularly 
shaped lesion 
measuring approximately 3.3 x 0.9 cm. There is no appreciable 
flow within this 
lesion. 
  
IMPRESSION: 3.3 x 0.9 cm mixed echogenicity area along the 
posterior margin 
of the bladder wall, likely represents intraluminal clot or 
debris. 
Irregularly thickened bladder wall is unchanged. 
.
___ BLADDER BIOPSY
1.  Edema, vascular congestion, hemorrhage and acute and chronic 
inflammation with scattered eosinophils.
2.  Urothelium largely stripped.
3.  Special stains for fungi (GMS and PAS-D) negative (with 
satisfactory positive controls).
.
___ FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: 
Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear 
unchanged. Multiple air-fluid levels seen in the left side, 
consistent with 
multiple hydropneumothoraces. New small right-sided pleural 
effusion is 
identified. Slightly increasing focus of opacity seen projecting 
over the 
right anterior second rib, possibly infectious. Persistent left 
retrocardiac 
opacity suggests combination of atelectasis and effusion, 
although 
consolidation cannot be excluded. A right-sided PICC line again 
seen, with 
tip projecting over the right atrium on a lateral view. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. New left-sided hydropneumothoraces. 
2. New right pleural effusion. 
3. Small focal opacity projecting in the right upper lung, 
possibly 
infectious. 
.
___ ___ doppler U/S
FINDINGS: Ultrasound evaluation of the right and left lower 
extremity deep 
venous system using gray-scale, color, and pulse wave Doppler 
reveals the 
veins to be fully compressible with normal color flow, Doppler 
waveforms, 
augmentation, and respiratory variation in flow. 
  
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT involving the right or left lower 
extremity. 
.
___ CT CHEST W/ CONTRAST
FINDINGS: There is a focal filling defect in a segmental branch 
of the left 
pulmonary artery, seen best on series 300B, image 28, but also 
in series 2, 
image 29. This appears to be the vessel going to the retained 
superior 
segment left lower lobe. 
  
The bilateral lungs demonstrate emphysematous changes. There is 
no acute 
pathology in the right lung. There are post-surgical changes 
identified in 
the inferior aspect of the left lung. In particular, a chest 
tube is 
identified coursing into a pocket of pleural air in the 
posterior aspect of 
the left lobe. There is a small amount of dependent pleural 
fluid inferiorly 
in the left lung, as well as additional air in the pleura 
anteriorly at the 
left lung base. There is patchy airspace density at the left 
lung base, which 
may represent postoperative contusion or infiltrate. Chain 
sutures are 
identified at the left lower lung. 
  
The pleural fluid with air in the posterior-inferior left lung 
appears to have 
enhancing pleura, consistent with empyema. The air can be 
explained ___ the 
indwelling catheter. However, possibility of bronchopleural 
fistula is 
entertained. 
  
There are atherosclerotic changes in the aorta. Tracheobronchial 
tree appears 
unremarkable. There is air distention of the proximal esophagus. 

  
The liver and spleen appear unremarkable. Adjacent to the 
spleen, there is an 
enhancing 1.6-cm focus, compatible with a splenule. The kidneys 
enhance 
symmetrically without evidence of focal lesion. There is no 
evidence of 
hydronephrosis. There is a small amount of biliary air noted in 
the left lobe 
of the liver, unchanged from the prior study. Patient is status 
post Whipple 
procedure. 
  
There is limited evaluation of the bowel due to lack of 
sufficient oral 
contrast. There is no frank evidence of bowel dilatation. 
Assessment for 
intra-abdominal abscess is very limited due to lack of oral 
contrast. There 
is stool throughout the colon. There is a right lateral 2.1 x 
1.1 cm bladder 
diverticulum. 
  
Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracolumbar spine. There 
is a paucity 
of subcutaneous fat and infiltration of the fat diffusely, 
compatible with 
third spacing. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Pulmonary embolus in segmental branch of left pulmonary 
artery as 
detailed. 
2. Posterior-inferior left lung pleural fluid and air with 
enhancing pleura, 
consistent with empyema. The air may be attributable to the 
indwelling 
catheter. However, the possibility of bronchopleural fistula 
must be 
considered. 
3. Post-surgical changes compatible with prior Whipple 
procedure.

Brief Hospital Course:
#LLL Empyema - The patient underwent thoracentesis and pigtail 
catheter placement for a left lower lobe empyema on ___ with 
removal of purulent pleural fluid. She was treated empirically 
with vancomycin and zosyn. Pleural fluid culture grew ESBL 
klebsiella, enterococcus, and ___ albicans.  Her 
antimicrobial regimen was changed to vancomycin, meropenem, and 
caspofungin. Caspofungin was changed to fluconazole after 6 days 
based on sensitivity data. Cytology was negative for malignant 
cells but was a degenerated specimen. The pigtail catheter was 
changed to a pneumostat prior to discharge. The patient has 
scheduled follow up with thoracic surgery and ID the week 
following discharge.
.  
#Cystitis - ___ species isolated from prior urine cultures 
dated ___ and ___ were refractory to voriconazole and 
amphotericin bladder washes during prior hospitalizations. 
During this admission she completed a 7 day course of 
amphotericin IV. She was also treated with a 7 day course of 
levofloxacin for bacterial cystitis based on urine cultures 
growing enterococcus and proteus species. Her dysuria was 
relieved with pyridium and urinary frequency and bladder spasm 
improved with oxybutinin.
.  
#PE - Incidental note was made of a PE in a segmental branch of 
the left pulmonary artery, the vessel going to the retained 
superior segment left lower lobe status post left lower lobe 
composite basilar segmentectomy on ___. Bilateral lower 
extremity doppler ultrasound was negative for DVT. The patient, 
the primary medical team, and the thoracic surgery team decided 
to defer anticoagulation due to the absence of symptoms, the 
inherent risks of anticoagulation particularly in light of her 
initial presentation of gross hematuria, and the atypical 
eccentric radiographic appearance of the clot and its proximity 
to the surgical site.
.
#Hematuria - The patient underwent cystoscopy, clot evacuation, 
fulguration, and bladder biopsy. Her hematuria resolved after 
the procedure. Cytology was negative for malignant cells or 
fungal elements. The pathology from the bladder biopsy revealed 
edema, vascular congestion, hemorrhage and acute and chronic 
inflammation with scattered eosinophils. GMS and PAS-D fungal 
stains were negative.  
.  
#Anemia - Transfused 2 units PRBC for Hct 23% on ___ and 1 U 
PRBC on ___ for Hct 24.3%. Hematocrit subsequently remained 
stable without signs or symptoms of acute bleeding. Iron studies 
were most consistent with an anemia of chronic inflammation.   
.  
#Malignant lung nodule - Pathology from a left lower lobe nodule 
resected on ___ revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma 
concerning for metastatic disease. CA ___ was elevated at 213 
U/ml. CEA and CA125 were within normal limits. She will undergo 
repeat torso CT 3 months post-operatively. The patient wishes to 
follow up with her oncologist at ___, Dr. ___.
.  
#DM - Glyburide was increased to 5 mg daily given hyperglycemia 
in the setting of infection and corticosteroid therapy. She was 
covered with a humalog sliding scale.
.  
#Crohn's - Continued prednisone and mesalamine.
.  
#Nutrition - Given a cardiac, diabetic diet.   
.  
#Prophylaxis - SC heparin, PPI, bowel regimen.
