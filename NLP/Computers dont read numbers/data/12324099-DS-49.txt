distress.
.
She was in fact recently admitted and discahrged on ___ 
for chest pain and hypotension while at dialysis on ___. 
Her chest pain at the time was per report in the setting of 
hypotension and lasted several hours. It resolved with 
administration of fluids at dialyisis. Her EKG did have 2mm 
up-sloping ST elevations in V2-V3, but in the absence of current 
chest pain and in comparison to previous examinations, it was 
felt not clinically significant.  Her cardiac biomarkers were at 
baseline, with a CK 38 and troponin 0.18. She was subsequently 
discharged on the same day of admission.
.
She went home, but had an increase in her shortness of breath. 
She reports that she in fact felt her heart racing at 
approximetly 10pm. She denies chest pain. She subsequently 
developed shortness of breath an hour or so later and 
re-presented to the emergecy department. 
.
In the ED she was found to be hypertensive 213/96 and arrived on 
BiPap from EMS sating 100%. She was placed on nitro gtt and 
given enalaprilat 0.625mg IV x 1. She was weaned from nitro gtt 
and placeds on a non-rebreatger. No further BP medications were 
administered. She developed hypertension again to the 180s 
systolic and was re-placed on Bi-Pap and nitrogtt. She arrived 
to the FICU sating 100% on 0.5mcg/kg/min nitroglycerine and 
BIpap 12 PS with 4PEEP. A blood gas was attempted, but was not 
succesfull. She had her BiPap removed and was doing well, sating 
100% on a facemask, but requested that she have her mask put 
back on as she felt she was not getting enough air with her 
breaths. This subjective feeling was not corroborated with 
objective data at the time, and her mask was replaced.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o woman with insulin dependent diabetes, end stage renal 
disease on hemodialysis, chornic diastolic heart failure who is 
admitted to the ___ ICU with respiratory distress.
.
ICU course:
Respiratory distress was thought to be ___ pulmonary edema due 
to diastolic CHF. Given h/o palpitations, CHF exacerbation could 
have been caused by a burst of a fib. She was transferred to the 
ICU on a nitroglycerine gtt which was quickly titrated. She was 
given HD with 3.5L of fluid taken off. Of note, per renal team, 
her dry weight is thought to be 46kg. By 2pm on the day of 
admission to the ICU, bipap was taken off (previously, pt had 
been reluctant to remove bipap) and she had O2 sat 100% on 4L NC 
at time of transfer to floor. Rate controlling medications 
including toprol, amiodarone and verapamil were ordered. 
However, verapamil was held on evening of floor transfer ___ 
SBPs 110s-120s after HD.  

Course on medical floor:
Patient remained stable satting 100% on RA with no further 
episodes of SOB. She received ultrafiltration on ___ as 
scheduled. She was discharged satting 100% on RA. She will 
continue to get HD ___ and UF on ___.

Her INR was low on admission. She was given 2mg coumadin daily 
(instead of alternating 1mg with 2mg). She was discharged on 2mg 
daily and will have her INR drawn at HD on ___ (tomorroW) and 
results faxed to ___ clinic for coumadin dosing 
as she normally does. At that point she may no longer require 
the double dose of coumadin and may be able to go back to her 
home dose.
