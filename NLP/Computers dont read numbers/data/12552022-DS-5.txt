Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with history of newly diagnosed alcoholic 
cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis (discharged on ___ treated with 
steroids, and pneumonia presenting with diffuse abdominal pain 
and anorexia x ___ontrolled with improving 
appetite.

# Alcoholic Hepatitis: Discriminant function of 37. Patient left 
with PICC line and there could be some concern for acute drug 
use and exposure to hepatitis virus. T. Bili continues to 
improve, patient not vomiting in 24 hours. Hep B viral load 
negative. It was decided that given his continued improvement he 
did not need steroids.

# Abdominal pain: Mmost likely due to both gastroenteritis and 
alcholic hepatitis. Has evidence of liquid filled bowels on CT 
which could be GI virus or also lactulose. Abdominal exam, 
downtrending lab values, and imaging are reassuring for other 
processes on DDx. Lipase ok. UA clean and UCx negative. Para 
showed few polys not consistent with SBP, with culture negative. 
Pain responded well to oxycodone. He was eating and drinking 
with no vomiting and having bowel movements for two days on day 
of discharge.

# Rash: His exam notable for a maculopapular rash in the UE and 
trunk. No mucosal involvment. Most likely viral exanthem vs. 
drug rash. Viral exanthem supported by gastroenteritis which is 
most often a viral process. Drug rash is also supported by the 
fact that patient has been on vancomycin, cefepime, lasix and 
azithromycin (all of which may cause rash) and mild eosinophilia 
on labs now resolved. Rash was resolving on discharge. He was 
not on antibiotics during this admission and his lasix was held. 


# Tachycardia: Developed in the setting of vomiting and poor 
appetite. Regular. Likely secondary to hypovolemia. He improved 
with 5% albumin. 

# Hepatic Encephalopathy: History in the past but none on this 
admission. His lactulose was initially held and then restarted 
on discharge.

# Ascites: mild on exam and US but CT scan showed increased 
ascites compared to the CT during last admission. He was on 
lasix 20mg daily. Bedside US with no good fluid pocket for 
paracentesis. Lasix was stopped given concern for rash with 
recommendation to follow up with ___ further 
evaluation.

# Nutrition: Pt reports anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, and poor 
muscle strength. Nutrition was consulted who recommended 
continued nutritional encouragement. He did not need enteral 
access nor tube feeds.

# Cirrhosis: Due to alcohol. Pt presented with alcoholic 
hepatitis on previous admission and was treated with steroid 
which had to be weaned off quickly due to pneumonia and 
encephalopathy. MELD score 20, which was 19 on discharge.
  
# Coagulopathy: INR 1.7 (downtrending) which was downtrending 
from last admission and with normal platelets. Pt reports 
intermittent black stool but rectal exam with brown stool and 
H&H overall stable. He was monitored and his INR remained 
stable.

Transitional
------------
- follow up on nutritional status, he is concerned about weight 
loss
- consider restarting diuresis with Lasix to challenge if this 
caused rash, or with ethacrynic acid if need other diuresis

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was our pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted with abdominal pain and poor 
appetite. We did many blood and imaging tests and saw no serious 
cause of your pain. You had some nausea, and your CT scan showed 
an area of intestines that could be due to a stomach bug. You 
improved slowly and on discharge your pain was manageable and 
your appetite improved. We hope you continue to get better.

Your lasix was stopped while you are having your illness and 
because we were concered about an allergy. Please follow up with 
your PCP and liver team this week to discuss restarting this 
medication.

The cause of your rash is unclear. Some medications including 
antibiotics and Lasix can cause a rash like this. In addition, 
some viral infections (GI bugs) can cause a rash like this. 
Almost every time the rash will clear on it's own.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
