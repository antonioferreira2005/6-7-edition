History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ yo woman with PMH significant for
orthotopic liver transplant (on tacrolimus) and multi-drug
resistant UTI who presented to the ED with bilateral ___ rash.

Patient reports a history of eczema since childhood that was
well-controlled, typically presenting with occasional lesions on
the medial aspect of her elbow. One month prior to admission, 
she
developed a self-reported "eczema flare" on her bilateral lower
extremities, particularly on her ankles and dorsal aspect of
knees. She described this rash as clustered, erythematous, 
raised
bumps associated with significant pruritus. Despite
hydrocortisone cream and PO antibiotics prescribed by her PCP,
the rash continued to spread to her entire ___, as well as
stomach, back, and arms, prompting her to present to the ED. She
endorses some chills and night sweats, but denies fever.

She also described an unrelated episode of burning with 
urination
2 days prior to admission, but reports that this has since
resolved and denies any current dysuria or urinary frequency. 
She
reports a history of intermittent perineal pain and dysuria.

In the ED, initial vital signs were notable for 98.5 | 60 |
131/66 | 16 | 95% RA. Exam notable for erythematous, warm,
slightly swollen ___ with flakey patches and associated
excoriation. Abdominal exam notable for suprapubic tenderness.
Labs were notable for low albumin 3.3, elevated lipase 65. Trace
leukocytes, 10 WBC, and few bacteria on UA. Patient was given 
NS,
PO oxycodone, and IV vanc.

Consults: Derm, Transplant Hepatology. Dermatology recommended
Cefazolin given concern for SSTI and clobatesol. Likelihood of
secondary syphilis was felt to be low.
 
Vitals on transfer: 98.1 | 136/72 | 60 | 16 | 95% RA  

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient was laying in bed and
pleasantly conversant. She continues to endorse ___ pain
bilaterally.

WOUND CULTURE (Final ___: 
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    MODERATE GROWTH. 
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during 
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are 
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four 
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may 
be
         warranted. 
         This isolate is presumed to be resistant to clindamycin

Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis status 
post OLT in ___ on tacrolimus, eczema, hypertension, 
depression, hyperlipidemia, asthma, chronic pain syndrome, and 
MDR UTI who presented with one month history of b/l ___ rash 
concerning for eczematous eruption with superimposed cellulitis.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Eczematous eruption complicated by right lower extremity 
cellulitis
The patient had a self-reported history of eczema and is 
followed in ___ clinic who presented with a history of 
pruritic skin rash and widespread scaly plaques most consistent 
with a pruritic eczematous eruption. Given erythema, edema, and 
TTP of R>L ___, eczema flare was also likely complicated by 
superimposed cellulitis. Dermatology was consulted and 
recommended topical steroids (clobetasol 0.05% ointment twice 
daily), aggressive emollient use and cefazolin for 10 days. The 
patient's wound culture later grew coagulase-positive staph and 
she was transitioned to cephalexin as she remained stable 
without other infectious signs or symptoms. Secondary syphilis 
was considered but thought to be unlikely and an RPR was 
nonreactive. Given her asymmetric right > left lower extremity 
swelling, a lower extremity doppler ultrasound was ordered but 
was negative for DVT.

# Alcoholic Cirrohosis s/p OLT (___)
The patient's LFTs were baseline admission and continued to 
remain so. She was continued on her home dose of tacrolimus 0.5 
mg twice daily and her Keppra levels were trended daily. As she 
was admitted as an inpatient, she underwent screening EGD and 
colonoscopy on ___ to avoid loss of follow-up.

# H/o MDR E. Coli UTI
Patient had history of MDR-E coli UTI sensitive only to 
meropenem, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, and zosyn. Although she 
was found to have WBC and bacteria on UA and initially had mild 
suprapubic tenderness to palpation, she was afebrile with normal 
WBC and did not endorse any current urinary symptoms such as 
dysuria, increased frequency, increased urgency, or back pain. 
She had been previously evaluated as an outpatient and 
infectious disease clinic for this finding but was due to have 
further workup of persistent perineal pain thought to be related 
to postmenopausal atrophic vaginitis and complex pain syndrome 
with OB/GYN. Given lack of symptoms, broad-spectrum antibiotics 
were deferred during her hospitalization. She was closely 
monitored for signs of infection and urinary symptoms.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# Chronic Pain
The patient was continued on oxycodone 5 mg twice daily as 
needed and gabapentin 300 mg twice daily.

# HTN
The patient remained normotensive since admission. She was 
continued on home lisinopril 2.5 mg daily and furosemide 20 mg 
daily.

# Asthma
Her O2 sats stable were on admission and she denied any recent 
asthma flares. The patient was continued on albuterol every 4 
hours as needed and fluticasone twice daily.

# Depression
The patient was continued on citalopram 40 mg daily.

# HLD
The patient was continued on atorvastatin 80 mg nightly.

# Insomnia
The patient was continued on trazodone 100 mg nightly as needed.

# Hx MI s/p cath
The patient was continued on aspirin 81 mg daily and metoprolol 
XL 50 mg daily.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[]Tamiflu: Continue taking Tamiflu 75 mg once daily for 10 days 
(last day ___
[]Cephalexin: Continue taking 500 mg every 6 hours for 10 total 
days of treatment (last day ___
[]Clobetasol: continue using twice daily until ___. Patient to

[]Tacrolimus: NO changes, continue 0.5mg very 12 hours
[]Esophagus, Stomach, Colon Biopsies: Please followup with GI 
office for pathology results, patient will be notified by GI 
office
[]History of MDR E. Coli UTI: deferred treatment give lack of 
symptoms, patient should follow-up with OB/GYN to rule out 
chronic pain component
