Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ male who was seen ___ the ED on ___ 
for his right leg wound erythema. He had a right lower extremity 
ultrasound done, which revealed no DVT. His wound was also 
cultured. His creatinine was also elevated to 1.6 on admission. 
He was admitted to the vascular surgery service and started on 
IV Vancomycin and PO Cipro/Flagyl for antibiotic coverage and 
daily labs for monitoring of his creatinine. Overnight, he 
spiked a temp of 101.0. On ___, he spiked another fever to 
102.0; he was pan-cultured, which eventually showed no growth ___ 
his blood or urine, and a CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia. 
On ___, a bedside incision and drainage was done with 
drainage of purulent exudate; the wound was cultured again. The 
previous wound culture revealed MRSA sensitive to vancomycin. 
Thus PO Cipro/Flagyl was discontinued, and a PICC line was 
placed for longer-term IV access for IV Vancomycin. From ___ 
to ___, the patient remained afebrile with improved pain 
from the wound area, BID wet-to-dry dressing changes, continued 
antibiotics, and improving creatinine. By the time of discharge 
on ___, patient was doing well, pain controlled, ambulating, 
voiding, tolerating regular diet. He was discharged home with 
___ services for wound care and IV vancomycin administration via 
the PICC line. His daughter (who is a ___) was also contacted
