History of Present Illness:
___ with PMHx Afib on coumadin, severe OA and chronic joint pain 
(shoulders, hands, hips, knees, elbows), CHF, severe lower

IMAGING:
------
PLAIN FILMS OF BILATERAL HANDS ___

Right:
Mild degenerative changes in the distal interphalangeal joints 
in the right
hand are worse in the fourth digit.  There are mild degenerative 
changes in
the first carpometacarpal joint with decreasing the 
intervertebral disc space,
osteophyte and sclerosis of the joint surfaces at these levels.  
There is mild
osteopenia.  
 
Left:
There is no evidence of fracture or dislocation in the left 
hand. Mild
degenerative changes in the distal interphalangeal joints are 
worse in the
fourth digit.  There is no evidence of dislocation at these 
level.  There is
decrease in the joint spaces and osteophytes.  There is mild 
osteopenia. 
There are no blastic lesions.  There is fracture of the styloid 
of the ulna. 
There pisiform seems located more superior and laterally in one 
of the
projections, but most likely is due to the projection.  Please 
correlate with
clinical symptoms.

PLAIN FILMS OF BIALTERAL KNEES ___
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little 
overall change in
the bilateral tricompartmental hypertrophic spurring, primarily 
affecting the
lateral areas with prominent spurring and some generalized 
narrowing of the
medial and lateral compartments.  No evidence of appreciable 
joint effusion.

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal wall thickness, cavity size, 
and global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 60 %). Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is a 
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic 
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Minimal aortic valve stenosis. Normal biventricular 
regional/global systolic function. Elevated left ventricular 
enddiastolic pressure. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the peak aortic velocity has mildly increased from 1.5 m/s to 
2.1 m/s however the severity of the aortic stenosis still 
remains minima

OA and chronic joint pain (shoulders, hands, hips, knees, 
elbows), CHF, severe lower extremity lyphedema, and CKD who 
presented with worsening pain of unclear etiology. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
---------
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY PAIN: INTERVAL 
IMPROVED. Likely due to polymyositis, given proximal muscle 
weakness, diffuse myalgias, and elevated CK. 
Alternate/additional etiologies include 1)inflammatory 
arthritis; 2) PMR, which is also possible given exquisite 
weakness; 3) fibromyalgia.
- Continue prednisone 15mg DAILY (___) for polymyositis.
- Trend ESR, CRP, CK.
- RF weakly positive, 21. 
- CCP PND.
- Follow up ___.
- Follow up bilateral hand X-rays 
- Increase Allopurinol to 200mg PO daily
- Hydromorphone PO ___ q6 PRN 
- Continue standing tylenol 
- Zofran for nausea  

# AoCKD: baseline Cr 2.1. On last discharge in ___ Cr 1.5.  
Cr 1.6 on admission, trending up to 2.2 on day of discharge. 
Likely pre-renal in setting of overdiuresis. Diuretics held on 
day of discharge, with plans to resume lower dosage of diuretics 
at home (see below), with follow up of Cr by PCP as outpatient. 

# Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled with carvedilol and dilt. 
Asymptomatic.  INR 1.9 on admission. Came in on 2.5mg warfarin 
daily. Increased to 3mg daily during hospitalization, with INR 
trending up to 3.1 on day of discharge, up from 2.6 the day 
before. Discharged on home dosage of 2.5mg daily with plans to 
follow up with ___ clinic on ___ to repeat INR and adjust 
warfarin if needed.

# BACTEREMIA: CONTAMINANT. ___ bottles positive for coagulase 
negative staph aureus.

# AS MURMUR: NO TTE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT DECREASED ___.

# DIASTOLIC CHF: STABLE. History of diastolic CHF with preserved 
EF. On admission asymptomatic and no signs suggestion CHF 
exacerbation, other than lower extremity edema. Diureteic 
regimen had been uptitrated over past several months due to 
progressive lower extremity edema; however, after being started 
on steroids for PS3PE, lower extremity edema significantly 
improved. Due to ___, likely secondary to overaggresive diuretic 
regimen, metolazone was stopped and torsemide dosage was 
decreased to 40mg, with plans for patient to weight self daily 
and to follow up with PCP for ___ of diuretic dosing as 
needed.   

___ ISSUES:
-----------
#Hyperlipidemia: Continued home dose simvastatin.  
.  
#GERD/mild gastritis on EGD: asymptomatic. continued omeprazole 
40 mg PO Q24H  

#HTN: Continued carvedilol

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
------
# follow up pending rheumatologic markers, pending blood 
cultures
# started on 16mg methylprednisilone, to be followed by 
rheumatology, blood pressure, blood glucoses to be monitored 
closely 
# started on fosamax 70mg qweek for osteoperosis ppx while on 
steroids, duration of course to be determined by PCP 
# diuretics reduced due to ___, discharged on 40mg torsemide 
with a Cr of 2.1; Cr and diuretics dosing to be followed up to 
PCP
# warfarin dosing likely needs adjustment, though no changes 
were made to home regimen; to have repeat INR on ___ and follow 
up with HCA coag.
# daily weights, to call MD if > 3lb weight gain
# CODE: DNR/DNI
#  EMERGENCY CONTACT HCP: Daughter ___ (healthcare 
proxy); Phone number: ___
