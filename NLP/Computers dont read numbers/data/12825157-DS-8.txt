IMAGING:
==========
- ___ CXR
1.  Right chest tube, with interval expansion of the right lung. 
 No new
pneumothorax.
2.  Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette, unchanged.

- ___ CXR
Comparison to ___.  Stable correct position of the 
right pigtail catheter.  No evidence of pneumothorax on the 
right.  Stable appearance of the left lung.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ year-old ___ speaking man with 
history of meningioma s/p near-total resection and radiation and 
pulmonary nodules, who was admitted for monitoring after 
undergoing ___ biopsy, procedure complicated by R 
pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement, ultimately with 
resolution of pneumothorax and discontinuation of chest tube 
prior to discharge.  
 
ACUTE ISSUES  
============  
# Right-sided pneumothorax  
Developed as complication of lung nodule biopsy. Underwent chest 
tube placement in PACU then admitted to medicine for monitoring. 
Serial CXRs with resolution of pneumothorax, and chest tube 
removed by interventional pulmonary prior to discharge. Pain 
controlled with Tylenol alone.

CHRONIC ISSUES:  
============-==  
# HTN: Continued home Losartan 25mg daily  

# BPH: Continued home Finasteride 5mg qhs

# Cataracts s/p Surgery: Continued home Latanoprost, Timlolol 
eye drops. Home Lumify NF so held and resumed on discharge. 
 
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] BAL with 1+ GPRs on gram stain (culture pending) - patient 
asymptomatic without hypoxia or active pulmonary symptoms, so 
treatment deferred, but please follow-up pending culture results 

[] Follow-up pending biopsy results

# Code Status: Full, presumed  
# Emergency Contact: Daughter, ___ (___)  

>30 minutes spent on discharge planning and coordination of care

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for monitoring after getting a 
nodule in your lung biopsied.

As a complication of your lung biopsy, you developed air around 
your lung (called a pneumothorax) that required a tube to be 
placed in your chest to help get the air out. You had chest 
x-rays that showed the air resolved, and the chest tube was 
removed. 

When you leave the hospital, please continue taking all your 
medications as prescribed and follow-up with your doctors ___ 
below for appointment information). 

It was a privilege caring for you, and we wish you well!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team
