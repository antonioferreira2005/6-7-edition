IMAGING:
========
___ Chest X-Ray:
FINDINGS: 
Spinal fusion hardware is are again noted without substantial 
interval changes compared to ___.  The lung volume 
is small, exaggerating bronchovascular markings.  There is 
bibasilar atelectasis.  Otherwise no focal consolidation.  No 
pulmonary edema.  No pleural abnormalities.  The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No acute osseous 
abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: 
No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.

___ MRI CERVICAL/THORACIC SPINE:
FINDINGS: 
Again seen are postoperative changes after laminectomy and 
posterior and anterior fusion in the upper thoracic spine.  The 
anterior fusion, involving T5 through T7, appears unchanged.  
The posterior fusion, involving T2 through CTA also appears 
unchanged.  There is no encroachment on the spinal canal and 
ample CSF is seen surrounding the spinal cord.  There is faint 
hyperintensity within the spinal cord at the T5-6 level on the 
T2 weighted images.  This is better seen on the current 
examination than on the comparison MR studies.  There is focal 
atrophy of the spinal cord at this level.  Deep thoracic 
kyphosis appears unchanged. There is no evidence of an abnormal 
fluid collection within or outside of the spinal canal.  There 
is no evidence of spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. 
There is no evidence of infection or neoplasm.
IMPRESSION:
1. Postoperative changes after decompression, laminectomy and 
anterior and posterior fusion in the upper thoracic spine.
2. No evidence of spinal cord compression or of abnormal fluid 
collection.
3. Focal spinal cord atrophy and a small area of abnormal 
increased signal intensity on the T2 weighted images at the 
surgical level.

___ US Upper Back Soft Tissue:
IMPRESSION: 
Approximately 4.2 x 4.1 x 1.2 cm area of edematous and 
hypervascular
subcutaneous tissue with foci of air in the right mid posterior 
trunk. 
Scattered tiny pockets of fluid about ___ cc each could be 
targeted for
aspiration if clinically indicated.  However, no large fluid 
pocket for drain placement.

___ TTE:
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is normal. The right atrium is 
mildly enlarged. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness 
with a normal cavity size. There is suboptimal image quality to 
assess regional left ventricular function. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal. The visually estimated 
left ventricular ejection fraction is 65%. There is no resting 
left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with depressed free wall motion. The 
aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending 
aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets (?#) are mildly thickened. No masses 
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No abscess is seen. 
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.5 
cm2). There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. No 
masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve. No abscess 
is seen. There is mild (MVA 1.5-2.0cm2) mitral valve stenosis. 
There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid
valve leaflets appear structurally normal. No mass/vegetation 
are seen on the tricuspid valve. No abscess is seen. There is 
physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No obvious vegetations.
Compared with the prior TTE ___, no gross change but the 
technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes 
definitive comparison.
RECOMMEND: If clinically indicated, a TEE is suggested for 
further evaluation of endocarditis.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ w hx MSSA bacteremia ___ T4-5 epidural abscess and discitis 
in ___ s/p multiple courses of antibiotic therapy, T5-T6 
corpectomy, T3-T8 posterior fusion, recent NSTEMI, HCV, CKD 
stage 3, remote IVDU w/ mitral stenosis, mild cognitive 
impairment, who presents with confusion and fluctuant mass on 
the R thoracic spine. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
===============

# Fluctuant thoracic mass
# Back pain
# Fever
Most likely source of fever is soft tissue infection/superficial 
abscess on her back. MRI showed stable postoperative changes 
without evidence of spinal cord compression, abnormal fluid 
collection, or epidural abscess. Neurosurgery reviewed images 
and thought no neurosurgical interventions needed. TTE ___ 
without evidence of endocarditis, no pulmonary, abdominal, or 
urinary symptoms. She may also have developed resistant organism 
while on doxycycline and or had a recurrence of prior infection. 
In the ED patient had a fever to 103. She defervesced and then 
remained afebrile once started on Vanc/Cefepime. Her mental 
status quickly improved after abx initiation. Infectious disease 
was consulted and felt that given elevated CRP this could 
possibly represent a recurrent bacterial infection if her 
hardware had been seeded during ___ episode MSSA bacteremia. 
An ultrasound was performed to assess the fluctuant mass on her 
back for potential fluid pockets for aspiration to further 
characterize the infection. Interventional radiology performed 
an aspiration of the site ___ with negative gram stain, and 
cultures without growth. Vancomycin and Cefepime were 
discontinued on ___ and she was discharged home on chronic 
doxycycline suppressive therapy. 

# Acute Encephalopathy: 
Patient was altered from her baseline on presentation. Her 
altered mental status resolved after antibiotics. The etiology 
of her encephalopathy is ___ infection.

# CKD III: 
Cr was 1.4 in ___, 1.5 on admission. ___ represent new 
baseline as Cr was 0.7-1.0 throughout ___.
Medications were renally dosed and nephotoxins avoided as able 
during this admission. Her Cr remained stable at 1.3. Discharge 
Cr was 1.3

# Anemia: normocytic, stable and chronic. ___ represent be AoCD 
from infection.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#h/o IVDU: continue methadone 89 mg daily
# Recent NSTEMI: Not on statin due to low ASCVD risk per HCA 
notes. Continue ASA
# Overactive bladder: oxybutynin ER not on formulary, oxybutynin 
5mg QID while in hospital. Discharged on home oxybutynin ER. 
# Pruritus: Pt with a history of pruritus. Continued home 
doxepin.
# Anxiety/Depression: Continued outpt wean from sertraline to 
duloxetine. Continued clonazepam 1 mg qAM and 1.5mg qPM. 
# Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine 112 mcg qd. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Continue home PO doxycycline 100 mg PO BID upon discharge. 
Provide prescription for patient until ID follow-up.
[] If concerned for hardware infection as outpatient, can repeat 
CRP. CRP was downtrending from 160 > 90 during admission and 
patient clinically improved. 
[] Consider repeat CRP at follow-up to ensure down-trending. 
[] Discharge Cr: 1.3

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You were admitted to the hospital because you were having 
fevers and you became confused at home.

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- We treated you with antibiotics to fight your infection.
- You had an MRI of your spine to make sure the infection was 
not affecting your spinal cord or the hardware in your back.
- We had our infectious disease specialists come to evaluate you 
to help us determine the most appropriate antibiotics to use and 
how long you should be on them for.
- We had our interventional radiologists take a sample from the 
site of your infection to determine if this could help guide 
antibiotic therapy.

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  
- Continue to take all your medicines as prescribed and keep 
your appointments.  
- Please take your antibiotics exactly as prescribed. 
- Please keep all of your follow up appointments. See the below 
section for the time and date of your appointments. You should 
be seen by your primary care doctor and PCP.
