Chief Complaint:
acute onset of nausea/vomiting, left facial numbness, left
facial droop, dysarthria and dysphagia
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
n/a

 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ ___ woman with a
history of lupus, migraines and depression and presents to the 
ED
after acute onset of nausea/vomiting, left facial numbness, left
facial droop, dysarthria and difficulty swallowing in the 
setting
of a week of headaches.  Neurology was consulted in the ED as
part of a code stroke protocol.  

Ms. ___ has had a severe, pulsatile, ___ headache with
photophobia for the past week that has been refractory to
fioricet.  The headache was quite atypical in its severity,
character, duration, and refactory nature. A few days after the
start of the headache, she had ___ days of posterior neck pain
and stiffness.  She described limited range of motion of the 
neck
and her boyfriend thought her neck looked swollen and there were
"knots" in her neck.  This improved with massage and topical
cream and there has been no neck pain or stiffness in the past 2
days.  This morning, the headache progressed to ___ pulsatile
left ___ headache.  She began to feel nauseated 
at
10am, but when her boyfriend left for work at 11am, she was
speaking normally and had no facial droop, weakness, or sensory
deficit.  She called her boyfriend at 1pm, after she had acute
onset of nausea,vomiting, dizziness described as room spinning,
choking sensation, left facial numbness, and difficulty moving
the left corner of her mouth.  Her speech was slurred because of
the facial weakness.  She did not have difficulty understanding
language and her boyfriend thought her language was slurred, but
otherwise made sense.  There was no double vision, walking and
strenght were normal.  

She came to ___ ED where initial vitals were stable (see exam)
and FSG 86.  Code stroke was called at 13:54.  On my arrival,
intial NIHSS was 3 for facial palsy, sensation, dysarthria. 
___ did not show hemorrhage, mass or early evidence of
ischemia.  CTA ___ and neck and CTV showed patent vessels. 
Given her low NIHSS, nondisabling deficit, and absent occlusion
on angiography, it was felt that tpa was a greater risk than
benefit and was not given.

ED course complicated by a trigger at 1515 for several
___ episodes of bradycardia to 39.  Unclear if these
were in the setting of nausea.  She did not have chest pain or
shortness of breath during the bradycardia, but had the 
lingering
nausea.  Nausea and dizziness resolved within 60 minutes. 

Of note, Ms. ___ is followed by Dr. ___ 
neurologist,
for migraines and ___ of possible CNS lupus.  With regards 
to
her migraines, she has migraines for over ___ years and now they
occur a few times per week.  Headaches are pulsatile, typically
start unilaterally and progress to the entire ___.  She has
photophobia, rare phonophobia, nausea, dizziness.  The headache
usually resolves with one fioricet and she does not miss time
from work.  She does not have visual or other auras with her
migraines.  In the past she has been on amitriptyline which was
only briefly helpful.  Her current headache is much more
prolonged and severe than her typical migraines.  

With regards to ___ of possible CNS lupus, the patient
discussed memory problems with Dr. ___ in ___.  She
will find herself grocery shopping and completely forget what 
she
is doing.  She make lists but this is still not helpful.  An MRI
was done in ___ which did was reassuring for absence of stroke
or vasculitis.

IMAGING 
=============================

___ Thyroid U/S
IMPRESSION:  
Two discrete vascular nodules within lower left thyroid lobe, 
largest within the lateral aspect of left thyroid measuring 2.1 
cm. Recommend biopsy of lateral most left thyroid nodule.

___ MR ___ w/o contrast
IMPRESSION:  
1. Small subacute infarcts in the left cerebellar hemisphere and 
left fornix. Additional focus of slow diffusion in the left 
frontal lobe without corresponding FLAIR signal abnormality may 
represent a more acute region of infarction. 
2.  Several small foci of T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensity in the 
subcortical and periventricular white matter of the right 
frontal lobe which are nonspecific but may be seen in the 
setting of vasculitis, demyelinating disease, small vessel 
ischemic disease, migraine headache, and Lyme amongst other 
entities. 

___ Echo
IMPRESSION: Likely patent foramen ovale/small atrial septal 
defect. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
regional and global biventricular systolic function. No valvular 
pathology or pathologic flow identified.

___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

___ CTA ___ and Neck
IMPRESSION: 
1. Unremarkable ___ and neck CTA without evidence of aneurysm, 
stenosis, or occlusion. 
2. No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis on ___ CTV  
3. Heterogeneous 11 mm nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid. 
Please refer to subsequently performed thyroid ultrasound for 
further information.  
4. Multiple enlarged left greater than right axillary lymph 
nodes which is a nonspecific finding. Clinical correlation is 
recommended. 
5. Partially visualized peripheral opacity in the left lung 
apex. Clinical correlation is recommended. 

___ CT ___ w/o contrast
FINDINGS:  
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or midline shift. 
There is no 
hydrocephalus. ___ differentiation is maintained. 
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are 
clear.Bone images unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  
No acute abnormalities are seen. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ ___ woman with a 
history of lupus, migraines and depression and presents to the 
ED after acute onset of nausea/vomiting, left facial numbness, 
left facial droop, dysarthria and difficulty swallowing in the 
setting of a week of severe headache.  Found to have small L 
cerebellar stroke concerning for embolic event in the setting of 
likely lupus anticoagulant.

# Cerebellar Stroke/Lupus Anticoagulant Syndrome:
- Patient was treated as a code stroke in the ED with NIHSS of 3 
for facial palsy, dysarthria and sensation (left face).  NCHCT 
was benign, no vascular cut off on vessel imaging.  Given 
___ deficit, tPA was deferred.  Admission labwork was 
otherwise benign and she was admitted to the Stroke Neurology 
Service.  Fortunately, by the next morning, her symptoms, except 
for mild vertigo had entirely resolved.  She underwent MRI of 
the brain, which as previous noted, found small subacute 
infarcts in the left cerebellar hemisphere and possible the left 
fornix.  

She was initially continued on Aspirin 81mg.  Of note, did 
report poor outpatient compliance, taking it approximately 3x/wk 
and having recently run out due to financial difficulties.  
However, she reported otherwise tolerating the medication well.

Further evaluation with Echo confirmed presence of PFO.  Lower 
Extremity venous duplex were negative.  Of note, she has a prior 
questionable history of Lupus Anticoagulant syndrome for which 
she took the aspirin.  Her positive Lupus Anticoagulant status 
was reconfirmed and diagnosis reaffirmed this admission.  
Hypercoagulable workup including anticardiolipin, B2 
microglobulin and protein C and S function were sent this 
admission, but pending on discharge.  

Hematology was consulted for antiplatelet vs anticoagulant 
management of her Lupus anticoagulant syndrome and recommended 
Coumadin, which was subsequently initiated with Lovenox Bridge.

# Thyroid Nodule
- Tyroid nodules seen incidentially on Neck CTA.  TSH was within 
normal limited and Free T4 ordered but pending. Subsequent 
Thyroid U/S found a left thyroid nodule measuring 2.1cm, for 
which radiology recommended biopsy.  This was deferred to an 
outpatient basis

# Headache
- Controlled symptomatic with ___ and 
ultram.

# Sinus Bradycardia
- Patient intermittently had asymptomatic sinus bradycardia to 
the low ___ on telemetry.  She was asymptomatic.  EKG and 
cardiac enzymes were otherwise benign.

===============================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===============================

- Left thyroid nodule 2.1 cm.  Radiology recommends outpatient 
biopsy.  Defer to patient's primary care physician. 
- Lovenox Bridge to Coumadin (INR Goal ___
