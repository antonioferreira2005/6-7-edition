Brief Hospital Course:
#Major depression:
Pt. admitted for episode of worsening depression and suicidal 
ideation with plan and prominent death wish. Pt. was felt to be 
help-seeking but with significant ambivalence and with possible 
psychodynamic fear of improvement. Following discussion with 
outpatient treaters and inpatient treatment team, pt. amenable 
to ECT treatment of depression. Pt. received medicine and 
anesthesia ECT clearance, with pt.s EKG showing normal sinus 
rhythm and delayed precordial R wave progression which was 
likely a normal variant. Pt.s lamotrigine was gradually tapered 
to discontinuation in effort to lower ECT threshold. Pt.s 
Ativan was also held on the evening prior to ECT treatments and 
pt. intermittently received diphenhydramine or quetiapine 25mg 
prn insomnia. Pt. received bitemporal ECT and following 
treatment sessions, reported experiencing side-effects of 
confusion and headache (see medical section below). Following 
first two sessions, pt. reported significant improvement in 
mood, appeared less depressed with more reactive affect. 
Following later sessions, however, pt. evidenced increased 
agitation, tearfulness, reported feeling more depressed, 
hopeless and pessimistic about resolution of depression. Pt. 
also reported increase in suicidality with more frequent 
thoughts and dreams, to the extent that she was equivocal about 
her ability to maintain her safety on the unit and seek help 
from staff. Pt. was amenable to starting antipsychotic to aid in 
reducing distress during this period, especially following 
discontinuation of lamictal, and was started on haloperidol 
2.5mg BID. Following pt.s fourth ECT session, she appeared 
significantly more distraught and reported increased suicidality 
with thoughts of hanging herself, and was placed on continuous 
observation by unit staff. Within a few hours, pt. reported 
improvement in suicidality, denied continued plan and was able 
to state she would reach out to staff appropriately if needed. 
Pt. did not evidence any behaviors concerning for self-harm 
during her hospitalization. Given level of pt.s depression and 
suicidality, treatment team felt pt. would benefit from 
additional stay in hospital for safety, stabilization and 
additional ECT treatments for complete treatment of depressive 
episode, which pt.s outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. ___, was in 
agreement with. Following fifth and sixth ECT sessions, however, 
pt. reported improved mood and requested discharge, however, pt. 
continued to appear depressed and evidenced limited future 
orientation, and was felt to continue to be at high risk for 
self-harm. Pt. initially declined additional ECT session due to 
severity of side-effects, but after encouragement by husband, 
was amenable to additional session of unilateral ECT to minimize 
occurrence of side effects. Following this session, pt. again 
requested discharge, and refused to engage in any additional ECT 
sessions.  Pt. was informed of treatment team recommendations to 
complete recommended course of ECT given severity of depression, 
continued intermittent suicidality and concern of relapse due to 
truncated ECT schedule (6 bilateral ECT, 1 unilateral ECT 
session), but pt. firmly declined and stated understanding of 
risks and benefits of such a course of action. Pt. reported 
improvement in mood with lessening of depression, denied 
hopelessness, denied suicidal ideation, intent, plan or 
preparation, stated future plans of attending partial hospital 
program, returning to outpatient treaters and ___ DBT group, 
which has been a significant source of support, meeting with 
friends, resuming school, as well as stated that if depressive 
symptoms worsened or pt. felt unsafe, she would contact 
outpatient treaters, 911, or return to ER. Pt. was restarted on 
lamictal in preparation for discharge as requested by outpatient 
psychiatrist. 
 
# Medical:
Constipation: Pt. reported experiencing constipation, which was 
managed with senna, colace and miralax.

post-ECT headache: Pt. reported experiencing bitemporal 
headaches following ECT. Pt. was given ibuprofen and 
acetaminophen prn for headaches, as well as was premedicated 
with Toradol IV prior to her ECT sessions. Pt. reported minimal 
improvement with medications, but complete resolution of 
headaches within a few hours following ECT. Following unilateral 
treatment, pt. reported mild headache and resolved quickly with 
medications. 

# Psychosocial:
Pt. participated in group sessions and unit milieu during 
hospitalization. Pt. was involved in family meetings with 
husband led by social worker, but declined to have treatment 
team contact daughter. Pt. was also in contact with Dr. ___ 
___ inpatient, holding a phone conversation with him on ___ 
prior to his vacation. In speaking to Dr. ___ reported 
that pt. expressed she was doing better, but he continued to 
support treatment teams recommendation for continued inpatient 
stay, additional ECT treatments, as well as recommended referral 
to a day program given that he would be out of town.
