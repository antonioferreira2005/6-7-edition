Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted on a conditional voluntary basis.  

Substance abuse:  He was placed on a CIWA protocol and a valium 
taper which he tolerated without adverse effects. He refused 
campral or antabuse, etc.  He refused referral for substance 
abuse treatment, explaining that he could stop drinking if he 
put his will to it.  

Psychiatry:  Patient's anxiety and depression remitted quickly. 
He found Seroquel PRN useful for anxiety. The patient 
participated in individual, group, milieu therapy.  Depakote was 
started for history of affective lability, impulsivity, and 
violence, and the medication was tolerated without side effects. 
 The patient appeared to understand the risks and benefits of 
Seroquel and Depakote including their effects on the liver and 
that they may cause weight gain.  The patient was told not to 
drink alcohol while taking psychiatric medications.  The patient 
reported feeling that Seroquel took the edge off of his anxiety 
and agitation but did not have a sense of whether or not 
Depakote provided any benefit for the 2 days that he took that 
medication.  His mood became more stable but he continued to 
report difficulty containing his anger.  At times he was 
inappropriate when interacting with other patients and staff 
(i.e. initiating hugs with female patient, cursing, and 
threatening staff).  Occassionally he would make gestures that 
could be interpreted as threats. He did not accept 
responsibility for these actions.  When we attempted to engage 
patient in monitoring his own behavior for the benefit of 
himself and other patients, he requested to be discharged.

Disposition:  The patient was encouraged to participate in an 
outpatient substance abuse program and/or AA meetings.  However, 
he wanted to be discharged prior to being able to complete 
discharge planning.  He refused a list of homeless shelters.  He 
accepted referral to the ___ for primary care and 
psychiatric care.  At discharge, the patient denied having 
suicidal thoughts, intent, or plan.  The patient denies HI, AVH, 
paranoia.
