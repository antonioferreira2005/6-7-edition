5. Severe paraseptal emphysema without pneumothorax. 
  
Chest xray ___:
IMPRESSION:  
-Compared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.   
-Aeration of the left lower lobe has been chronically 
compromised, reflected ___ elevation of the left hemidiaphragm,, 
there is more consolidation there today and on ___ when 
there was also a new moderate left pleural effusion.  
-There has been no change ___ either since.  Apical thoracostomy 
tube ___ place.   
-Left lower lobe collapse or pneumonia and moderate left pleural 
effusion are unchanged.  No pneumothorax.

-Pigtail pleural drainage catheter projecting over the left mid 
and lower chest replaces a previous left apical thoracostomy 
tube.  Moderate left pleural effusion has not improved, there is

SUMMARY: Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH quadriplegia secondary to GSW 
to the head, DM, GERD, and left PTX treated at ___ 1 month (s/p 
tube thoracostomy and pleurodesis) presenting from rehab because 
of worsening SOB and chest pain for 2 days, found to have 
L-sided empyema growing MRSA and pseudomonas. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
===============
# L sided empyema 
# Superficial soft tissue infection
Patient status-post placement of L pigtail catheter at ___ 
___ for PTX 1 month ago, likely secondary to 
emphysema/blebs. He presented with significant L sided chest 
pain, shortness of breath, and leukocytosis. CT and chest xray 
on admission notable for LLL collapse and loculated pleural 
effusions. This also showed lobar collapse that had been present 
for years. Pleural fluid sample from Heimlich valve/chest tube 
consistent with exudative effusion and grew pseudomonas and 
MRSA. His chest tube was removed and replaced by a pigtail 
catheter by Interventional Pulmonology, which led to improvement 
___ pleural effusion seen on CXR. ___ hospital course was 
complicated by difficult access, requiring a left IJ, which was 
replaced with an ___ ___ his right UE given the need for 
prolonged abx. Infectious Diseases was consulted who recommended 
treatment with vancomycin and cefepime through ___ with 
follow-up arranged ___ ___ clinic. CT chest on ___ showed 
significant improvement ___ his empyema and his chest tube was 
switched to water seal and removed on ___. 
[] Continue vancomcyin and cefepime for planned six-week course 
(stop date ___, afterwards please remove RUE PICC

Vancomycin trough, LFTs, CRP and fax them to ATTN: ___ 
CLINIC ___
[] All questions regarding outpatient parenteral antibiotics 
after discharge should be directed to the ___ 
R.N.s at ___ or to the on-call ID fellow when the 
clinic is closed. 

#Leukocytosis and thrombocytosis - Ongoing throughout admission, 
treatment for infection as above. Patient was additionally given 
fluconazole 150mg x2 for balanitis as below. MRI spine did not 
show any signs of osteomyelitis or abscess. Given ongoing 
leukocytosis, APAP was held to ensure that no fevers were being 
masked. No concern for new, evolving infection at time of 
discharge despite persistent low level leukocytosis and 
thrombocytopenia.

# COPD 
# History of asthma
Patient with reported history of asthma with no PFTs on file. He 
was on theophylline as an outpatient but was unsure of who was 
managing it. He was having a lot of insomnia, which improved 
after stopping theophylline after discussion with interventional 
pulmonary. He has blebs/emphysematous changes on CT chest 
concerning for undiagnosed COPD with previous smoking history. 
Dose of Advair was increased ___ the setting of stopping 
theophylline. 
[] Would recommended outpatient PFTs 

# Junctional rhythm 
# Supraventricular tachycardia
Patient was noted to have new junctional rhythm on ___. He was 
asymptomatic and it resolved without intervention. The patient 
denied chest pain, palpitations, SOB or nausea. Repeat EKG on 
___ was unremarkable. The episode occurred prior to placment of 
his L IJ. Per cardiology, likely a vasovagal episode ___ the 
setting of chest tubes and infection with low concern for sick 
sinus syndrome. TTE on ___ showed ejection fraction of 59% and 
moderately dilated right ventricle with low-normal free wall 
motion. TSH was 3.5. His lytes were monitored with goal K > 4 
and Mg >2. He also developed one brief episode of SVT that 
self-resolved. Cardiology consulted who recommended holding beta 
blocker. 
[] Holding bisoprolol pending Cardiology follow up

# Quadriplegia
# Decubitus ulcer, present on admission
Patient with hx of lower back pain secondary to immobilization 
and decubitus ulcers noted on prior admission ___ ___. 
Patient had continued back pain which was managed with Oxycodone 
10 mg PO Q4H:PRN, Baclofen 30 mg PO TID, Acetaminophen 1000 mg 
PO Q8H. Tizanidine 6 mg PO prn TID was held given that diazepam 
works better (discharged on 2.5-5mg BID). Wound care consult was 
placed, please see page-1 for recommendations. 
[] Continue wound care of sacral ulcer as per page-1

# Contractures
Patient with severe contractures of his upper extremities 
bilaterally. Per patient, occurs ___ the setting of pain. Likely 
exacerbation of his chronic neurologic disease. Contractures 
were managed with pain regimen per above and improved by time of 
discharge. 

# Polypharmacy
Patient with multiple recent medication lists ___ the setting of 
hospitalizations and rehab stays. Attempted to remove 
unnecessary medications.
[] Consider ongoing need for cholestyramine 
[] Stopped medications (see discharge medication list) that were 
not needed or unsafe

# Vitamin deficiencies
Patient evaluated by nutrition and started on MVI with minerals. 
He was also given vitamin C, vitamin A, and zinc for a total of 
14 days (last day ___ 

# Elevated alkaline phosphatase
Alk phos elevated to 180s-190s with GGT 86. RUQUS without 
biliary dilatation or concerning findings. No bony or liver 
symptoms and other LFTs normal. Anti-mitochondrial antibodies 
negative.
[] Monitor alk phos as outpatient. Consider hepatology referral 
if rising

# Seizure history
Per ___ records: "Per neurology, given EEG with bilateral 
frontal encephalomalacia, could be source of epileptic activity. 
No definitive seizure captured as of yet on EEG but given story 
(time skips and likely post ictal state) and prior similar 
events per family, patient would benefit from starting 
antiepileptics.  He was thus discharged on keppra 500 mg BID and 
was advised to follow up with his outpatient neurologist at 
___, Dr. ___ Patient continued on Keppra BID. 
[] Outpatient EEG/Neurology f/u 

# DMII
Given poor glucose control, increased regimen to basal/bolus 
regimen at higher doses. Regimen at time of discharge: Lantus 
25U qHS, prandial Humalog 10U TID, HISS.
[] Continue to titrate insulin regimen for optimized diabetes 
control, may need further downtitration (had been on Lantus 8U 
qd on admission without any standing prandial Humalog)

#Cutaneous candidiasis: Complaining of penile pain with 
urination, noted on ___ to have candidiasis on his penis and 
perineum. He was started on 0.2% miconazole cream bid and 
additionally given two doses of fluconazole 150mg. Penile 
discharge was cultured, results pending at time of discharge.
[] Complete 7 day course of miconazole cream (last day ___
[] f/u culture for fungal sensitivities, fluconazole resistance 
is possible

# Polyuria: was noted to have polyuria for a few days prior to 
discharge. Etiology unclear as hyperglycemia was resolved by 
then and no effect on his sodium. Urine electrolytes Na 86, 
Urine Osm 491, serum sodium 135, measured serum osm of 284 also 
with a calculated serum osm of 284 (___). Given that he was 
receiving fluids previously for c/f hypovolemia, he may still be 
redistributing and diuresing
extra volume. He may also have suffered ATN earlier this 
admission and may now be recovering. Clinically, he is not 
hypovolemic and his serum sodium stable. Unfortunately he was 
non-compliant with fluid restriction attempt. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Normocytic anemia
At baseline, ~ 11. Likely AOCD versus iron deficiency. No 
evidence of active bleeding. Iron studies notable for iron 29 
and normal ferritin. 
[] Consider outpatient iron repletion

# Ileostomy
Patient with ileostomy secondary to abdominal pseudoobstruction 
and dysmotility. Patient was continued on home Loperamide and 
home Diphenoxylate-Atropine. Loperamide dose decreased to 
typical dose. 

# Insomnia
Improved after stopping theophylline. Given Ramelteon prn sleep. 


# GERD
Continued formulary PPI. 

# HLD
Continued home Cholestyramine 8 gm PO TID
