Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o male who presented to his PCP earlier today with one week 
of shortness of breath found to have bilateral PEs.

#  Pulmonary embolism: Patient with bilateral PEs, first 
occurrence and appeared to be unprovoked (no travel h/o, recent 
surgery, h/o malignancy, up-to-date with colon CA screening). 
Also no family history of hypercoagulable conditions although 
has paternal history of vasculitis with late onset asthma and 
thus sent off ___ and ANCA(pending at discharge). No DVT 
symptoms; only with superficial vein thrombosis on R ankle. 
LENIs were negative. Pt hemodynamically stable and not hypoxic. 
Troponin negative with low BNP which were reassuring, making 
right heart strain not likely. No contraindications to 
anticoagulation. Pt with normal renal function and not morbidly 
obese and thus able to give Lovenox. He was discharged with 
Lovenox SC 100mcg (1mcg/kg) BID and coumadin 5mg daily, aiming 
for INR goal of ___. Patient's PCP was contacted to have patient 
referred to ___ clinic. Patient will need at least 3 
months of warfarin for unprovoked episode but advised patient to 
discuss with PCP whether he should continue ongoing 
anticoagulation vs aspirin after three months. Other 
transitional issues: hypercoagulable workup in process with PCP- 
___ ___ sent and pending; we recommended checking HIV 
status as outpatient.

#Hypercalcemia: Patient with elevated calcium levels to ___, 
asymptomatic. Besides hyperparathyroidism, malignancy and 
autoimmune diseases are worrisome in healthy active pt with

Transitional issues:

pending
-Inpatient team recommended checking HIV status as outpatient
-Patient is to ___ with PCP on ___ to have INR 
check 
-Patient has referral to ___ clinic; patient given

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were admitted to the hospital for management of the clots in 
your lungs, a condition called pulmonary embolism. You had an 
ultrasound of your legs which did not show clots in your deeper 
veins. We are giving you two medications to thin your blood to 
prevent other clots from forming- Lovenox/enoxaparin and 
warfarin/coumadin. You are to ___ with your primary care 
doctor next week ___ to have your blood tests to check your 
"INR." Your doctor ___ also update you on the lab test- ___ 
five Leiden which was sent off on ___ at her office. We sent 
off two lab tests that test you for a certain type of 
"vasculitis." The results were pending when you were discharged. 
We will notify your primary care doctor regarding the results. 
Following this appointment, you will be following up with the 
___ clinic to monitor your INR levels. You will likely be 
taking warfarin for at least 3 months. After that, you should 
have a discussion with your primary care doctor whether you 
should stop warfarin completely or stay on it since you are at 
high risk of having another clot in the future. You asked about 
dietary restrictions while you are on coumadin- we recommend 
that you eat a normal diet but Avoid LARGE amounts of alfalfa, 
asparagus, broccoli, ___ sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, 
green teas, kale, lettuce, spinach, turnip greens, and

levels.
