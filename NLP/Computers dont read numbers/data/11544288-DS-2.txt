room doors of other students, yelling this, not making any

staying up later than normal, going to bed around 5am, although
apparently pt always went to bed later than ___.

tears.   He reports that patient otherwise seemed to have been
doing well in school, making friends and successful in classes.

past.

  As per patient's mother, patient has not been at his baseline
since this past ___ (5 days PTA). His parents had gotten a
brief phone call this past ___ from him on facetime, where he
appeared normal. However, on ___ he called and spoke with
his father for an hour and a half (far more time than usually
spent on phone as he had not been overly communicative since he
began college). His thoughts did not appear straight, "back and
forth" with several sentences stating that he "finally 
understood
what happiness was about," "understood how everything worked,"
and "The mind was very powerful and it made him so that he could
stop smoking cigarettes."
  On ___, patient called his mother, using the same phrases
and words that he had used on ___ night's call. He made
comments like "I'm so smart now, I'm a genius, I know the 
truth."
He also posted on What's App everything that he had learned in

philosophical writings" on Facebook stating "The mind is 
powerful

also ___ him on ___ asking how he was doing to which he
responded "Super Good."
  On ___ night (___), parents recieved another hour and a
half phone call where he talked about discoveries that he had
made. Yesterday, family recieved another strange phone call 
where
patient was crying inconsolably (something that mother had not
seen patient do since he was a child). The pt told his mother
that "you won't understand the sadness that I'm feeling right
now, I'll call you back," but did not call her back.  When mom
called him back, he stated "I'm better" and seemed closer to his
baseline. They also recieved an e-mail yesterday from patient's
___ stating that he was worried about the patient. Later

night was when parents were called that pt was taken to the

3. Psychiatric: 
#) Mania - Patient was BIBA from ___ for erratic 
behavior and mania-like symptoms for one week following 
ingestion of ___ and acid at a concert with his friends. Due 
to agitation in the ED, the patient recieved physical and 
chemical restraints. On admission, the patient was floridly 
manic as evidenced by grandiose delusions ("I am Jesus"), rapid 
speech, hypersexuality, poor sleep, and flight of ideas. Zyprexa 
10mg BID was started and titrated to antimanic response. Due to 
partial response depakote 750mg BID was added with improved 
therapeutic effect. VPA level was checked and found to be 
therapeutic at 86. No side effects other than mild sedation were 
noted. Gradual improvement in symptoms, insight, and behavioral 
control was noted. Patient was able to verbalize that he would 
no longer need drugs to maintain "happiness." Regarding 
diagnosis, the patient met criteria for mania with psychotic 
features. Differential includes Bipolar disorder with initial 
manic episode precipitated by psychoactive substance ingestion 
vs. substance-induced mania with psychotic features. Regardless 
of diagnosis, patient is at elevated risk of manic episodes and 
this risk is further elevated by illicit substance use. 
Longitidunal follow-up is recommended to further elucidate this 
differential. On discharge, the patient was euthymic, denying 
overt delusions, demonstrated good insight/judgment, and was in 
good behavioral control. On discharge, patient was able to state 
that he would abstain from all drugs upon discharge.

Collateral Information: 
#) OUTPT TEAM - Patient did not have any outpatient providers on 
admission. Patient did see a counselor, ___ 
(___) for ___ years in
high school due to adjustment problems and bullying. Voicemail 
was left for ___ regarding the patient's inpatient 
admission. At the time of discharge, additional voicemail was 
left for ___ to provide clinical updates. 

#) HOSPITAL RECORDS - ___ OMR records were reviewed.

4. Social/Milieu: 
#) GROUPS - Patient attended many groups on the unit following 
the breaking of his mania. He particularly enjoyed music group 
and journaling. 

#) FAMILY - With the patient's permission, ___ spoke with the 
patient's family to provide clinical updates and obtain 
longitudinal collateral. Several family meetings were held 
focused on psychoeducation, medication compliance, importance of 
abstinence from illicit drugs, and relapse prevention. SW 
communicated with ___ regarding a medical 
leave of absence for the remainder of the semester with plan for 
the patient to move back to his parents home until next 
semester. Mother remained supportive of the patient during 
hospitalization and was in agreement with treatment and 
disposition plans.

5. Risk Assessment: 
The patient represents a chronic risk of impulsive and 
potentially dangerous behaviors given his ongoing substance 
abuse. Modifiable risk factors addressed during hospitalization 
include the following: mania (started zyprexa), substance abuse 
(counseling, detoxification), and access to suicidal means 
(restricted to unit). Protective factors include that he is 
currently in good behavioral control, medication compliant, able 
to engage in relapse prevention planning, future oriented and 
connected with outpatient treatment. At this time, the acute 
risk has been diminished and the least restrictive setting for 
care is the outpatient setting.
