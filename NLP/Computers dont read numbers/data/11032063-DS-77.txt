STUDIES:
___ CT A/P:
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is increased 
intrahepatic biliary dilatation with acute tapering at the level 
of the head of the pancreas. Given the extensive pamcreatic 
calcification likely from chronic pancreatitis, potential 
etiology of CBD obstruction includes stricturing. The liver, 
spleen, both adrenals are unremarkable. The patient is status 
post cholecystectomy. There are calcifications within the 
pancreas consistent with sequelae of chronic pancreatitis. 
Multiple hypodensities within both kidneys likely represent 
benign renal cysts. No abdominal, retroperitoneal or mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy is noted. The patient has had prior bowel 
surgery noted in the right upper quadrant, unchanged. The small 
and large bowel is otherwise unremarkable. No abdominal free 
fluid or free air is noted. 
.
IMPRESSION: Increased intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary 
ductal dilatation with abrupt tapering at the level of the 
pancreatic head. Recommend clinical correlation and MRCP to 
exclude obstructing mass.  
.
.
___ LIVER USN:
IMPRESSION: Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilatation with no 
clear 
obstructing lesion identified. Please note that the distal CBD 
and head of 
the pancreas were not visualized secondary to overlying bowel 
gas.

___ y/o M with PMHx significant for chronic pancreatitis admitted 
with abdominal pain similar to prior presentations of

# acute on chronic pancreatitis - pt presented with symptoms

"increased intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal 
dilatation with abrupt tapering at the level of the pancreatic 
head."  LFTs were initially elevated (200s), but trended down 
quickly.  This could represent a passed stone, inflammatory 
stricture, or mass.  MRCP was recommended, however pt elected to 
be discharged home and pursue this as an outpt.   A follow-up 
appointment was made for him with Dr. ___ to follow his 
LFTs, and he was instructed to call to schedule an MRCP
