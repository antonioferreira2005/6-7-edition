Pertinent Results:
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRASTStudy Date of ___ 12:38 ___
FINDINGS:
 
 
There is no acute fracture or malalignment in the cervical 
spine.  Mild
multilevel degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine 
are noted with
mild intervertebral disc space narrowing, annular disc 
calcification and
osteophyte formation without critical central canal or neural 
foraminal
narrowing. No prevertebral edema.  The aerodigestive tract 
appears patent.
 
Visualized lung apices are clear. The thyroid gland appears 
heterogeneous with
no discrete lesion visualized.  Left shoulder arthroplasty is 
noted on the
scout.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
 
1. No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment of the cervical 
spine.
2. Mild multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRASTStudy Date of ___ 12:38 ___
FINDINGS: 
 
There is no intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhage, edema, shift 
of normally
midline structures, or evidence of acute major vascular 
territorial
infarction.  Again seen are scattered punctate calcifications 
within the left
cerebral hemisphere, likely dystrophic, possibly related to 
prior infection or
trauma.  Prominent ventricles and sulci are consistent with 
age-related
involutional changes.  Periventricular and subcortical white 
matter
hypodensities are seen, likely sequelae of chronic small vessel 
ischemic
disease.
 
No fracture is seen.  Mild left frontal soft tissue swelling is 
noted.  Mild
mucosal thickening of the ethmoidal air cells and minimal 
bilateral maxillary
sinus mucosal thickening is noted. The remaining imaged 
paranasal sinuses are
clear. Mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are well 
aerated.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
No acute intracranial process.  Minimal left frontal soft tissue 
swelling.

GLENO-HUMERAL SHOULDER (W/ Y VIEW) LEFTStudy Date of ___ 
12:56 ___
FINDINGS: 
 
Patient is status post left shoulder arthroplasty. No hardware 
complications
are evident. Mildly displaced fracture of the distal left 
clavicle with
minimal superior displacement of the distal fracture fragment is 
noted.  There
is no widening of the acromioclavicular joint.  No dislocation 
is present. 
Mild degenerative spurring is noted involving the 
acromioclavicular joint.   
Visualized left lung demonstrates atelectatic changes.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
Mildly displaced fracture of the distal left clavicle.  No 
acromioclavicular
dislocation or evidence of hardware complications.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ is a ___ yr old male with locally advanced pancreatic
cancer no longer on therapy who is admitted after fall and
possible syncope at home, found to have severe hypoK.  
Syncopal episode/Presyncope - Unclear if pt truly had LOC. 
likely
related to orthostasis as he reports positional lightheadedness
as well as severely low K. No arrhythmia on arrival.  
- monitored on tele during hospitalization with no events
- pt declines diagnostic studies such as echo, CT to r/o PE
 
#Severe hypoK - K 1.9 on arrival. ___ poor PO intake and Lasix
use. improved with repletion. stopped lasix which should help. 
For now reports improved edema with TEDS, hopefully this will 
benefit and avoid need for lasix. will DC on 20meq daily 

___ edema - chronic, using compression stockings now to avoid 
lasix given hypokalemia

# orthostatic hypotension - improved since admission. midodrine
added ___. ___ eval: recommend rehab
 
#locally advanced ___ cancer s/p systemic
chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX x 8 cycles and local radiation 
which
completed ___. at last onc visit in ___ pt chose to take
comfort focused approach, was struggling w/ PO weight loss but
decided he would not want treatment even if had recurrence thus
no further intervention pursued. He has gradually stopped taking
meds as per HPI above. Has home hospice, typically visits about
1x/week. Would like to return home after rehab, but unclear if 
he
will have enough support to stay there as his health 
deteriorates

#L clavicle mildly displaced frx - pt declines pain meds, sling
in place for at least few weeks  

#anemia: likely related to his disease process, was previously 
requiring periodic transfusions. slight drop at DC but no 
evidence of active bleed.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ after ___ fall. You hit 
your head and broke your left collarbone. This did not require 
surgery but you should wear a sling for the next month while the 
bone heals. We found that your potassium levels were very low, 
for which you received potassium supplementation. You will be 
discharged to rehab where you can try to regain some strength 
before you go home again. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay here. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
