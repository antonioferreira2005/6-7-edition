IMAGING:
===============
___ CT A/P with IV Contrast
FINDINGS:
- LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits.  
There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion. 
- ABDOMEN: 
-- HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation 
throughout.  There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no 
evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  
The gallbladder is within normal limits. 
-- PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, 
without evidence pancreatic ductal dilatation.  There is a 4 mm 
hypodensity within the mid body of the pancreas (02:18), likely 
compatible with small side-branch IPMN.  There is no 
peripancreatic stranding. 
-- SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation 
throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. 
-- ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in 
size and shape. 
-- URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal nephrogram.  There is a 1.1 cm hypodensity within the 
left upper renal pole (02:18), compatible with simple renal 
cyst.  Additional subcentimeter hypodensities in the bilateral 
kidneys are too small to characterize, though likely compatible 
with simple renal cysts.  There is no evidence of 
hydronephrosis.  There is no perinephric abnormality. 
-- GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable.  Small bowel 
loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and 
enhancement throughout. Distal transverse colon, splenic 
flexure, and descending colon are decompressed.  Mild concentric 
wall thickening involving these segments could represent mild 
colitis, or possibly secondary to bowel decompression.  The 
appendix is not visualized, however no secondary signs of 
inflammation in the right lower quadrant. 
- PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are 
unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis. 
- REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: There is an enlarged, fibroid uterus. No 
adnexal 
abnormality is seen.  There is an intrauterine device in place, 
low lying in position likely secondary to fibroids. 
- LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy.  There is no pelvic or inguinal 
lymphadenopathy. 
- VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Mild 
atherosclerotic disease is noted. 
- BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or 
acute fracture. 
- SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal 
limits. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Distal transverse colon, splenic flexure, and descending 
colon are decompressed.  Mild concentric wall thickening 
involving these segments associated with surrounding soft tissue 
stranding and prominent pericolonic vessels could represent mild 
colitis. 
2. Enlarged, heterogeneous fibroid uterus.  Low-lying position 
of IUD in the lower uterine segment and endocervical canal. 
3. Tiny 4 mm hypodensity within the mid body of the pancreas, 
likely compatible with small side-branch IPMN-MRCP may be 
performed for better evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with T1DM on insulin pump, 
celiac disease, jackhammer esophagus, hypothyroidism, ADD who 
presented with BRBPR iso abd pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea x 
days.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: 
=======================
#?INFECTIOUS GASTROENTERITIS vs COLITIS
#SEPSIS
#HEMATOCHEZIA
Ms. ___ presented with fevers, leukocytosis, worsened 
tachycardia in the setting of abd pain, nausea/vomiting, 
diarrhea, BRBPR, which together met sepsis criteria. CT imaging 
was re-read as possible colitis of descending/distal transverse 
colon. Most likely infectious colitis or gastroenteritis. BRBPR 
could also be infectious process worsening known internal 
hemorrhoids. Upper GI sx could also be related to underlying 
celiac disease, uncontrolled T1DM. Ddx included inflammatory 
colitis given pt report of similar episode in past, but last 
colonoscopy/bx in ___ without evidence of this. She was started 
on ciprofloxacin/flagyl with improvement in her symptoms (last 
dose ___. Infectious workup was ultimately negative for noro, 
Cdiff, salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and E.coli O157:H7. 
Blood cultures were no growth to date. She was hemodynamically 
stable throughout, with Hb also stable. GI felt that there was 
no role for inpatient colonoscopy. On discharge, pt was 
clinically feeling at her baseline. She was managed 
symptomatically with reglan iso possible gastroparesis. As an 
outpatient, can consider gastric emptying study if symptoms 
persist.

#TOXIC-METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, resolved
#METABOLIC ACIDOSIS
#CONCERN FOR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS
#TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS, UNCONTROLLED
The patient was noted to have continued somnolence and new noted 
anion-gap metabolic acidosis on ___ labs. A broad workup was 
sent. Despite sugars only in 200-300s, UA showed new ketonuria, 
ABG showing normal pH likely ___ metabolic acidosis with 
appropriate respiratory compensation. With fluid administration 
and uptitrated basal insulin rate via pump, gap closed. Serum 
tox did not show ASA, ethanol, appreciable tylenol to explain 
other causes of AGMA. Urine tox results as below. Lactate wnl, 
so was less concerned for worsening of sepsis as above. Blood 
cultures remained no growth to date. ___ continued to follow 
and advise through hospitalization. BS improved to 100's at time 
of discharge.

#HYPONATREMIA, resolving
#APPROPRIATE ADH RESPONSE iso VOMITING
Ms. ___ was noted to have hyponatremia. It was felt that iso 
vomiting, this was appropriate response in ADH. Roughly 
normalized with increased PO intake.

#URINE TOXICOLOGY (+)BARBITURATES
During workup for potential altered mental status, found to have 
barbiturates in utox. Unclear where barbiturates would be coming 
from, as review of medications being given in hospital would not 
produce either true or false positive. Pt does not recall any 
medications she took that could produce this. Rare case reports 
of barbiturate(+) with NSAID administration in literature, which 
pt is not getting here. Discussed with pt that if pt was taking 
barbiturates as outpt, would be concerned given other sedating 
medications on PAML (eg. methocarbamol). Discussed concern that 
pt has been somnolent while in hospital, though this likely is 
multifactorial in etiology.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: 
=========================
#TACHYCARDIA
#AUTONOMIC NEUROPATHY
Has documented tachycardia as outpatient, for which she follows 
with Dr. ___. ECG here showing sinus tachycardia. TSH during 
admission was 1.2. Continued home metoprolol given stability.

#CELIAC DISEASE
Well documented history of abdominal pain and distension in the 
setting of her underlying celiac disease, though worsened as 
above. Continued home regimen.

#ADD
Per conversation with outpatient providers, ___ 
reflects both Adderall and Vyvanse due to insurance issues and 
patient should only be receiving one or the other. However, per 
patient report, she is taking both together. Adderall was 
continued while inpatient. As transitional issue, should clarify 
dosing.

#HTN
Continued Lisinopril 20mg daily given clinical stability.

#HYPOTHYROIDISM
Continued home levothyroxine 125mcg daily. TSH 1.2 as above, 
though would be hesitant to interpret in setting of acute 
illness.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
MEDICATIONS
