IMPRESSION:
1. Large bowel wall-thickening and submucosal edema in the 
vascular
distribution of the ___. While there is no apparent stenosis or 
thrombosis of the ___, proximally, a more distal arterial 
occlusion cannot be excluded; however, this overall appearance 
of bowel may also be seen with "low-flow" venous ischemia. 
Inflammatory and infectious processes also remain differential 
diagnostic considerations, that might be assessed by 
colonoscopy.
2. Periportal edema and small ascites, particularly perihepatic. 
This may relate to the process, #1, above and/or to volume 
overload with "third-spacing."
3. Bilateral simple-appearing renal cysts. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
# Colitis - There was initial concern for ischemic colitis that 
would require surgical intervention. Lactate was 1.0 on arrival, 
increased to 2.0 several hours later, but repeat lactate was 
1.3. Patient clinically improved quickly, and surgery was not 
necessary. Presentation and CTA findings were consistent with 
ischemic colitis in ___ distribution, but 
infectious/inflammatory colitis could not be excluded as no 
occlusion was seen in ___. Ciprofloxacin and flagyl were 
continued throughout admission and stool studies were sent and 
pending upon discharge. Patient was without abdominal pain and 
was tolerating PO.

# Hypotension: Pt was borderline hypotensive with complains of 
intermittent lightheadedness. Lisinopril was held and IVF @ 
125cc/hr given. When patient was able to take PO, fluid and salt 
intake encouraged. BPs returned to normal when patient returned 
to normal diet and she was no longer lightheadeded.

# Anemia: Patient reported bloody bowel movements, but they 
ceased after admission. Hemoglobin decreased with hydration from 
12.4 on admission to a low of 9.5. It rose to 10.0 on day of 
admission. Transfusion was not required.

# Hypokalemia: Was likely due to GI losses. Resolved with 
repletion.

# HTN: Lisinopril was held due to borderline hypotension. Pt 
instructed not to restart his medication until she followed-up 
with her PCP.

# Hyperlipidemia: Stable. Continued simvastatin, aspirin 81mg. 

# GERD: Stable. Continued omeprazole. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Outpatient colonoscopy recommended
# Stool studies are pending upon discharge and must be 
followed-up.
# Discuss when to restart lisinopril w/ PCP.
# Will follow-up with ACS.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were transferred to ___ for evaluation of your 
abdominal pain. A CT scan of your abdomen done at ___ 
___ showed inflammation of your colon. The doctors at 
___ were concerned that you may have had ischemic colitis, 
which is a condition in which the colon does not get enough 
blood supply and is damaged. This can occur because of very low 
blood pressure or because of a clot in the vessels that supply 
the colon. The doctors at ___ were concerned that you may 
have needed surgery, so you were sent to ___. The 
surgeons here did not believe that you needed surgery because 
you were feeling better. We got another CT scan of your abdomen, 
which showed that your colon had not suffered more damage; it 
was unchanged from your CT scan in ___. It also did not show 
any clots or blockages in the blood vessels that supply your 
colon. 

It is also possible that the inflammation in your colon is due 
to infection (infectious colitis), so we gave you antibiotics 
while you were in the hospital. We also tested your stool for 
bacteria. The results of your stool tests have not yet returned. 
We will contact you with these results when they are available. 
You no longer need to take antibiotics. 

When the inflammation in your colon has resolved, we recommend 
that you get a colonoscopy. Please discuss the timing of this 
procedure with your primary care doctor and with the surgeon at 
your follow-up appointment.

While you were in the hospital, your blood pressure was lower 
than it normally is, so we stopped your blood pressure 
medication (lisinopril). You should not restart this medication 
until talking with your primary care doctor. You should also 
drink lots of fluids to help keep your blood pressure up.

We made the following changes to your medications:
1. lisinopril - we stopped this medication.

We have scheduled follow-up appointments for you with your 
primary care physician and with acute care surgery. If you 
cannot keep your appointments, please call to reschedule.

It was a pleasure taking part in your care. We wish you a quick 
recovery and good health.
 
Followup Instructions:
