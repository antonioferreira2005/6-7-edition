DIAGNOSIS: 
Pancreatic body mass, enucleation:

Pancreatic endocrine tumor, well differentiated, 0.9 cm in 
greatest dimension; see note and synoptic report.

Note:  Demonstrated is a well-circumscribed nodular tumor 
excision without adjacent pancreatic parenchyma.  The tumor 
cells are arranged in cords and nests with focal densely 
sclerotic fibrosis and have relatively monomorphic nuclei with 
evenly dispersed chromatin and tiny nucleoli.  No necrosis is 
seen. Mitoses are inconspicuous, however, prominent 
cautery/crush artifact precludes evaluation of many areas. A 
thin rim of fibrous tissue (measuring on average 1-2 mm) is 
present around a majority of the lesion, however, it is focally 
disrupted, and cauterized/crushed tumor is present at ink in 
these areas 

Immunohistochemical stains of the tumor are positive for 
cytokeratin cocktail, chromogranin and synaptophysin, with 
satisfactory controls, supporting the morphologic diagnosis. No 
definitive staining for gastrin is identified (clinical history 
of elevated gastrin level is noted).

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient with possible pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor was 
admitted to the HPB Surgery Service for elective resection. On 
___, the patient underwent laparoscopic enucleation of 
pancreatic mass, which went well without complication (reader 
referred to the Operative Note for details). After a brief, 
uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor 
tolerating clears, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter and a JP 
drain in place, and PO Dilaudid for pain control. The patient 
was hemodynamically stable.
Neuro: The patient received PO Dilaudid with good effect and 
adequate pain control.  CV: The patient had one episode of rate 
control atrial fibrillation post op. The patient was restarted 
on his home cardiac medications, follow up ECG was normal. The 
patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital 
signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient has a long history of smoking and quit 
right before the operation. Post op he was required to have 2L 
of supplemental O2 to maintain O2 saturation above 90%. The 
oxygen was weaned off on POD # 4, the patient remained stable 
from a pulmonary standpoint.
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well 
tolerated. The patient reporter low appetite post op. JP amylase 
was checked on POD # 3 and was high (___), the patient was 
discharged home with JP drain to bulb. The amylase level will be 
checked again as outpatient on ___. Patient's intake and 
output were closely monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when 
necessary.  Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted 
when necessary.
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout 
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.
