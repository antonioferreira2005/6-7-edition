Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with a history of CAD and MI ___ s/p 3x stents, 
DM, and recent choledocholithiasis s/p stent placement in ___ 
in ___ who presents with nausea and vomiting.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Gastroenteritis: Presented with symptoms of vomiting and 
diarrhea and no pain more consistent with viral or possibly 
bacterial food-borne illness rather than a CBD problem. US at 
___ showed persistence of the known stone but not 
ductal dilatation, and his normal Tbili, alk phos, and 
transaminases suggest the CBD stent is patent. He had risk 
factors for food-borne illness from his vacation to ___. CT 
with oral contrast did not reveal pathology, and C. diff testing 
was negative. He was supported with IVF, and his symptoms 
improved to the point where he was able to tolerate food and 
liquid. Return precautions were discussed, and he will follow up 
with his PCP. Stenting for choledocholithiasis was performed in 
___ 2 weeks ago, so he will need repeat ERCP for stent 
removal in 4 weeks. He wanted to pursue this closer to home, but 
we provided our Advanced Endoscopy team's contact info.

___ on likely CKD: Initial Cr was 1.9, likely prerenal from 
vomiting and diarrhea. IVF were administered, and his Cr 
plateaued at 1.6. He was making urine. This may be his baseline 
kidney function.

pictures. Your symptoms may take a few more days to completely 
resolve. Stick to bland foods for now to avoid making the 
diarrhea worse.

4 weeks close to home. Otherwise, out team here would be happy 
to perform the procedure if you call ___.
