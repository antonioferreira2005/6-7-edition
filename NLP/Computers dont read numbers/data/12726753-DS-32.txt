No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

___ TTE 
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with mild basal inferior hypokinesis. No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Doppler parameters are 
most consistent with normal left ventricular diastolic function. 
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly 
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male with history of dCHF, 3V CAD being 
managed medically, cirrhosis with recent admission for variceal 
bleed (___ last week) presents with crescendo chest pain with 
negative biomarkers and increasing weight, volume overload, and 
DOE.  

# Chest pain: Worsening chest pain with exertion over the last 3 
days. Negative torponinx2 that resolved with diuresis. CP most 
likely from increased stretch/stress in the setting of CAD w/ 
fixed defects during an episode of diastolic heart failure 
exacerbation. There was concern for unstable angina but given 
recent bleed he would be at high risk for bleed if he was 
heparinized or sent to cath lab for stenting.
 - Continue home anti-anginals, aspirin/statin  
 
# Acute on chronic ___: Patient with grade 1 diastolic 
dysfunction on ECHO and mild systolic dysfunction. Presented 
with ___ edema and crackles on exam with ___ weight gain 
(admission weight 166.6lb). Admitted last week to ___ for GIB 
and was volume resuscitated, which contributed to acute 
exacerbation. Auto-diuresed w/o medication with decrease in 
weight to close to baseline 161.6lb. TTE on ___ was 
unchanged from prior. 
- Weight at discharge 73.1kg (161.6lb), unclear dry weight 
- Increased nadolol to 40mg daily (from 20mg daily)
 
 # Hx of recent GIB: Presented to ___ with melena and had 
workup there with imaging. Was fluid resuscitated but unclear if 
he received blood products. No evidence of bleeding during this 
stay.

Chronic:  
 # HIV: continue HAART & Bactrim prophylaxis 
 # T2DM: cont home detemir 
# Cirrhosis: Likely ___ NASH from HIV meds, c/b esophageal 
varices s/p banding (most recently in ___. Was continued on 
rifaximin started at ___.    
# Pancytopenia Likely multifactorial in the setting of HIV, 
cirrhosis, ongoing Bactrim use and chronic disease. 
 # HTN: amLODIPine 7.5 mg PO DAILY  
 # Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine Sodium 150 mcg PO DAILY

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 

You came in with chest pain. We found you were not having a 
heart attack or angina. It seems that your heart failure was 
exacerbated by the fluids you recently received during your GI 
bleed. We monitored you closely and our body removed the excess 
fluid by itself. A repeateEchocardiogram was unchanged from 
prior times which is good news. We optimized your medications by 
increasing your nadolol dosage. Your symptoms resolved so you 
were discharged home. Your weight at discharge was  161.6lb. 
Please follow up with your outpatient doctors. 
___ was a pleasure taking care of you.

Best,
Your ___ Care team
