lateral ribs suggest fracture. The associated ground-glass 
opacities are thought to be related to trauma, therefore 
pulmonary contusions. Other considerations include pneumonia, 
correlate for infectious symptoms.

left-sided rib fractures.

morphine ___ and tylenol and she remained on this regimen with

there is any illicit opiate use, this is pending and will be 
followed up with her PMD. On the morning after her admission, 
she experienced some nausea and required Zofran. She had no 
CP/SOB/Abd pain and this was attributed to an exacerbation of 
her pain. this resolved quickly and without recurrance. 

2.Depression/bipolar: she had no issues or symptoms while 
hospitalized

3. Osteoporosis: A workup for her osteoporosis revealed the 
following: Normal renal function, normal chemistries including 
calcium and phos. Normal TSH, normal liver function. A 25 - OH
