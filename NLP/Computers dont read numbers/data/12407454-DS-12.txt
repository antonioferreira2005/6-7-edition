Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Chest and left arm pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ with a H/O severe dementia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, left-sided CVA, metastatic prostate cancer, pulmonary 
embolism, GI bleed, and recent admission to ___ 
___ for sepsis and pulmonary embolus, ultimately 
discharged home with plan for transition to hospice, now 
presenting as a transfer from ___ with several hours of 
possible chest and left arm pain
and EKG changes concerning for acute ischemia.

On ___, patient was noted to be extremely diaphoretic, cool 
and clammy, by nursing staff at his long term care facility. It 
was also reported patient was stating he had right arm pain at 
the time. VS were notable for BP 134/63, HR 91, and SaO2 99% on 
RA. The decision was made to transfer for ___ for a 
higher level of care. 

Upon arrival to ___, patient was able to endorse left arm 
pain, but responded no when questioned about chest pain. VS were 
notable for Temp 97.4F, HR 97, RR 21, BP 131/54, and SaO2 99% on 
RA. Labs were notable for a troponin-T 0.02, but were otherwise 
unremarkable. EKG demonstrated new anterior T-wave inversions 
concerning for ___ sign, and inferolateral ST depression,
both of which were new when compared with previous EKG in ___. He received aspirin ___nd IVF and was started on a 
heparin and nitroglycerin drips prior to transfer to ___.

Of note, patient has a MOLST form from ___ which is DNR 
but ok to intubate/ventilate. Per transfer referral from ___ 
___, patient is full code per family/HCP. Also worth noting, 
aspirin/clopidogrel and furosemide were discontinued at prior 
discharge and it is unclear if losartan was also discontinued.

Initial VS in ED were notable for Temp 96.8  HR 100  BP 138/73  
RR 16  SaO2 100% on O2 2 Lpm via ___. Labs were notable for a 
troponin-T of 0.02, which improved to 0.01 five hours later. 
CK-MB was flat at 2. Otherwise labs were unremarkable, including 
creatinine of 0.6. CXR demonstrated a left basilar/retrocardiac 
opacity and mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but no gross 
volume overload. EKG was similar to ___, although with 
more prominent T-wave inversion in anterolateral leads, again 
concerning for ___ sign. It also demonstrated LAD and LVH. 
Bedside ultrasound demonstrated a LVEF of ~40% with septal 
hypokinesis. Cardiology was consulted and felt the differential 
for patient's presentation was ACS vs. pulmonary embolus with RV 
strain vs. cerebral T-waves, with ACS being the most likely 
etiology. However, as patient has an extensive list of 
co-morbidities, was recently discharged with plan for hospice, 
and patient was unable to discuss/family not reachable, the 
decision was made not to proceed with emergent coronary 
angiogram. It was felt any intervention would require careful 
discussion of risks/benefits and goals of care. Patient was 
continued on heparin and nitroglycerin drips in ED. Vital signs 
on transfer were HR 88  BP 110/52  RR 18  SaO2 100% on O2 2 LPM 
via NC.

Upon arrival to the ward, patient ws unable to provide further 
history given baseline dementia, answering minimal questions 
yes/no. He did not know where he was and pointed to left arm/leg 
when asked about pain.

___ Blood culture x2 - no growth

___ Echocardiogram
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ 
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
top normal cavity size. There is moderate global left 
ventricular hypokinesis (biplane LVEF = 37 %). [Intrinsic left 
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the 
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The estimated cardiac index 
is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size is normal 
with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or vegetations are 
seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to 
suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on the 
mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal 
image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
There is no pericardial effusion.

___ CXR
Left basilar/retrocardiac opacity, for which developing 
infection is considered in the appropriate clinical setting. 
This should be followed on subsequent x-rays to resolution. No 
evidence of pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 

___ LEFT GLENO-HUMERAL X-RAY
Suggestion of slight cortical disruption of the posterior 
greater tuberosity may represent small nondisplaced fracture 
versus physeal scar. Mild left AC and glenohumeral joint 
degenerative changes. Suggestion of mild superior subluxation of 
the humeral head could represent underlying rotator cuff tear.

___ for sepsis and pulmonary embolus, ultimately 
discharged home with plan for transition to hospice, now 
presenting as a transfer from ___ with several hours of 
possible chest and left arm pain, and EKG changes concerning for 
acute ischemia.

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
# NSTEMI: Patient presented with left arm pain and possible 
chest pain from SNF to ___. Troponin-T was found to be 
elevated at 0.02, and EKG demonstrated new anterior T-wave 
inversions, concerning for ___ syndrome, and inferolateral 
ST depressions, both of which were new when compared with 
previous EKGs in ___. Patient received aspirin 600 mg per 
rectum and was started on a heparin and nitroglycerin drip prior 
to transfer to ___. At ___, troponin-T fluctuated from 
0.01-0.03 and CK-MB was flat with eGFR >75 mL/min/1.73m2. 
Biggest concern was for ischemia/recent infarct with proximal 
LAD stenosis and ongoing myonecrosis. However, following 
discussion with the family and consideration given to patient's 
numerous co-morbidities, the decision was made to medically 
manage, as the likely risks of proceeding with coronary 
angiogram and PCI outweighed the benefits. Patient was started 
on aspirin 81 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg daily. Heparin drip was 
transitioned to therapeutic dose enoxaparin. Nitroglycerin IV 
was transitioned to a nitroglycerin patch. Home metoprolol 
tartrate was consolidated to metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily. 
Echocardiogram on ___ demonstrated a LVEF of 37% and global LV 
dysfunction of unclear chronicity. Patient reported no further 
episodes of chest pain throughout admission. 

# Non-displaced fracture of left shoulder: Patient reported left 
arm pain on admission, which was a chronic issue as an 
outpatient. Left shoulder X-ray demonstrated a possible small 
non-displaced fracture at the posterior greater tuberosity of 
the left shoulder. Orthopedics were consulted and felt there was 
no acute intervention warranted, but stated patient could 
follow-up with orthopedics (sports) in two weeks as an 
outpatient if pain persisted.

# Moderate-severe aortic and mitral regurgitation: 
Echocardiogram on ___ demonstrated moderate-severe AR/MR of 
unclear chronicity. Given the severity, there was concern for 
possible endocarditis, but blood cultures ultimately showed no 
growth in the setting normal temperature and normal WBC. 
Afterload reduction was optimized with clonidine patch and 
losartan as discussed below. Patient remained hemodynamically 
stable. If develops fevers at facility, consideration should be 
given to possible endocarditis as the underlying etiology.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
# Dementia, Chronic moderate malnutrition, Dysphagia: Patient 
with a background history of CVA and severe dementia. Per 
discussion with One Care, ___, where patient is currently 
living, he is bed-bound and minimally verbal at baseline, even 
with interpreter. He was evaluated by speech and swallow during 
admission; no evidence of aspiration was seen, and he was deemed 
safe to continue pureed diet with thick liquids.

# HFrEF: TTE during admission demonstrated a LV ejection 
fraction of 37% of unclear chronicity. He was not on a diuretic 
as an outpatient, although previously had a trial of same. No 
diuretic was started as patient seemed euvolemic. Losartan 50 mg 
daily was restarted for afterload reduction. Metoprolol was 
transitioned to metoprolol succinate 50mg daily for 
neurohormonal blockade. Weight on discharge was 51.6 kg.

# Recent PE/DVT: Restarted Lovenox, adjusted for patient's 
current weight, at 50 mg BID. On discharge, patient should start 
Lovenox 80 mg daily on ___ and continue on this. 

# Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Not on medications as an outpatient. 
Did not require insulin sliding scale while he was an inpatient.

# Hypertension: Patient prescribed clonidine patch 0.3mg/hr as 
an outpatient. On arrival to ___, blood pressure and heart 
rate were elevated. No clonidine patch identified on skin. With 
replacement of same, tachycardia and hypertension resolved. 
Patient was also restarted on losartan 50 mg daily. It is 
important to continue both clonidine patch 0.3 mg/hr and 
losartan 50mg daily as an outpatient. Clonidine patch should be 
replaced every ___.  

# Epilepsy: Continued phenytoin 100 mg daily and 200 mg QHS 
during admission. Patient should continue this medication at his 
facility.

# Metastatic prostate cancer: Per discussion with son, patient 
carries a diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer, but was 
deemed not a candidate for surgery about ___ years ago. 
Previously was receiving six monthly hormone injections. 
Currently on no treatment.
