Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency department and was 
evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found 
to have a left hip femoral neck fracture and was admitted to the 
orthopedic surgery service. Medicine was consulted for 
preoperative clearance and felt that she was safe to proceed 
with surgery. The patient was taken to the operating room on 
___ for left hip hemiarthroplasty, which the patient 
tolerated well (for full details please see the separately 
dictated operative report). The patient was taken from the OR to 
the PACU in stable condition and after recovery from anesthesia 
was transferred to the floor.  The patient was initially given 
IV fluids and IV pain medications, and progressed to a regular 
diet and oral medications by POD#1. The patient was given 
perioperative antibiotics and subcutaneous heparin TID instead 
of Lovenox for anticoagulation due to her renal impairment. The 
patient's home medications were continued throughout this 
hospitalization, except that her mealtime insulin doses (20 
units Novolog TID) were decreased to account for decreased PO 
intake post-operatively (10 units Humalog TID) with a sliding 
scale. She was continued on home dose Lantus. The patient worked 
with ___ who determined that discharge to rehab was appropriate. 
The patient did have some increased serosanguinous incisional 
drainage so an incisional vac was placed on POD#3 and removed on 
POD#4 as there was no drainage. The hospital course was 
otherwise unremarkable.

At the time of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable 
vital signs that were within normal limits, pain was well 
controlled with oral medications, incisions were 
clean/dry/intact, and the patient was voiding/moving bowels 
spontaneously. The patient is WBAT in the left lower extremity, 
and will be discharged on 2 weeks of TID subcutaneous heparin 
for DVT prophylaxis. The patient will follow up in two weeks per 
routine. A thorough discussion was had with the patient's 
daughter regarding the diagnosis and expected post-discharge 
course, and all questions were answered prior to discharge.
