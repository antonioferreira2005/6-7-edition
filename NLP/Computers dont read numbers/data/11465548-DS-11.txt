Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with history of end stage renal disease 
who was admitted for nausea/vomiting/pruritus, as well as 
hypertensive emergency, with systolic blood pressures up to 
200-230s upon presentation. He was noted to be in progressive 
renal failure in urgent need of initiation of hemodialysis. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Hypertensive emergency: Patient presented with systolic blood 
pressures up to 223/112 in the ED and troponinemia concerning 
for end-organ damage, though troponinemia confounded by ESRD. 
Cardiology evaluated the patient in the ED before admission and 
felt that there was no need to continue trending cardiac enzymes 
due to  low suspicion for acute coronary syndrome, advising 
instead improved blood pressure control. He did not endorse any 
dizziness, lightheadedness, chest pain, palpitations, or 
headaches upon presentation, and decreased vision bilaterally 
was unchanged from baseline and felt to be attributable to 
bilateral vitreous hemorrhage as below. Over the course of his 
stay, he was maintained on his home antihypertensive regimen, 
which included labetalol, hydralazine, lisinopril, and 
isosorbide, with addition of amlodipine for improved blood 
pressure control, with systolic blood pressures largely under 
170s at discharge. 

#End stage renal disease: On admission, patient was endorseing 
nausea, vomiting, and pruritus likely secondary to uremia. Also, 
he reported orthopnea and paroxysmal noctural dyspnea presumed 
to be secondary to volume overload. He was scheduled to have an 
___ tunneled line placed the morning after admission, as 
his AV fisula that was placed on ___ was not yet mature. 
Placement of the left-sided line was uneventful. He received 4 
sessions of HD in-house, and during each of the last 2 sessions, 
he had 4L volume taken off. Overall, he tolerated the sessions 
well. During session #4, his systolic blood pressure rose again 
to the 200s, and his anti-hypertensives which had not been 
administered prior to the session were given during dialysis. 
Systolic blood pressure decreased to 95, and UF was adjusted 
accordingly. He returned to the floor complaining of dizziness, 
which self-resolved within ___ hours. PPD placed and hepatitis 
serologies sent this admission, all of which returned negative. 
He was placed at an outpatient HD center on a 
___ schedule. He was discharged on 
___, and per discussion with renal, would initiate 
outpatient sessions on ___. He has follow-up 
scheduled with Dr. ___ his AV fistula; once that has 
adequately matured, patient's tunneled line can be discontinued. 
His sevelamer and calcitriol were continued throughout this 
stay.

#Left upper extremity swelling: Patient did complaint of left 
upper extremity swelling during this admission, which improved. 
He did have a left upper extremity ultrasound, which returned 
negative for DVT. Swelling was thought to be secondary to volume 
overload in the setting of need for initiation of dialysis.

#Visual changes: Patient reports decreased vision in his right 
eye, and was noted to have a right vitreous hemorrhage, possible 
secondary to diabetic retinopathy, on a prior admission. He was 
transported to the ophthalmology clinic during this admission 
for follow-up visits, as well as a laser procedure in the right 
eye. Patient tolerated the procedure well. He has a scheduled 
laser treatment for his left eye for the week after discharge, 
which also contains some degree of vitreous hemorrhage. He was 
instructed not to drive, and was discharged safely to ensure 
that someone could take care of him considering his visual loss 
on the right. 

# CT head changes/ splenium hypodensity: Patient received a CT 
head upon presentation to rule out intracranial hemorrhage/ 
increased intracranial pressure in the setting of hypertensive 
emergency. While CT was negative for intracranial hemorrhage, it 
did reveal a new hypodensity in the splenium of the corpus 
callosum in the absence of focal neurologic deficits, hence of 
unclear significance. An MRI could be considered for further 
work-up; however, the patient was not to receive gadolinium 
during his initial sessions of hemodialysis due to 
nephrotoxicity. If further evaluation is necessary in the 
future, nephrology will need to be consulted before any studies 
are ordered and obtained. 

INACTIVE ISSUES:
#Chronic Diastolic heart failure: Last echo demonstrated an EF 
of 50% and diastolic dysfunction with severe pulmonary 
hypertension and increased TR/MR. ___ continued his home 
diuretics of Torsemide and Metolazone during this admission, 
with continued urine output.

#Hyperlipidemia: Continued home Atorvastatin.

#Anemia: At baseline. Likely iron-deficiency complicated by CKD. 
We continued iron replacement, and maintained an active type and 
screen. Patient received 1 unit PRBC this admission, with 
appropriate response in hemoglobin and hematocrit. 

#Diabetes mellitus type 2: His last A1c 6.3% in ___. 
Complicated by diabetic retinopathy (likely) and diabetic 
nephropathy.  Patient was maintained on a humalon ISS in-house. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Patient will need close follow-up with nephrology at his 
outpatient dialysis appointments.
-He has follow-up scheduled at the ___ with Dr. 
___ his maturity of his fistula/ readiness for use will 
be assessed at that time.
-Patient should follow-up with his PCP to optimize blood 
pressure control regimen.
-Patient is already being seen in the ophthalmology clinic and 
being followed for his right eye vitreous hemorrhage, for which 
he received an initial laser treatment on this admission. Close 
follow-up is scheduled.
-MRI is advised for further characterization of corpus callosum 
lesion noted incidentally on admission CT, with gadolinium 
contraindicated in the initial sessions of hemodialysis (and 
perhaps indefinitely) due to nephrotoxicity; there were no clear 
focal neurologic deficits, with visual changes felt to be 
attributable to vitreous hemorrhage as above.
-No pending studies.
-Code status: Full

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were admitted to 
___ for worsening kidney failure and inititaion of 
hemodialysis.  You were found to have very high blood pressure 
at admission, causing your heart to work very hard. We increased 
your blood pressure medicines, and the interventional 
radiologists placed a dialysis line because your AV fistula was 
not mature yet.  You were started on hemodialysis for a total of 
four sessions during this admission.  

While you were admitted, you saw the ophthalmology doctors for 
follow/up for your right eye hemorrhage. You were seen in the 
office on ___ and returned for a follow-up visit on ___ 
for a second follow-up, as well as a laser eye treatment.

You had a CT scan of your head because we were concerned about 
your high blood pressure and your vision changes for the past 2 
months. We also saw a small change in a CT scan of your head, 
for which we recommend a follow-up MRI.  

Weigh yourself every morning, and please call your MD if your 
weight goes up more than 3 lbs
 
Followup Instructions:
___
