IMAGING / STUDIES:
# RENAL US ___ at 12:44 ___:
FINDINGS:  The right kidney measures 11.7 cm and the left kidney 
measures 12.2 cm.  There is fullness of the renal pelves 
bilaterally, but there is no hydronephrosis, stone, or mass.  
Renal echogenicity and corticomedullary architecture is within 
normal limits.  The bladder is moderately well seen and normal 
in appearance.
IMPRESSION:  Normal renal ultrasound.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year old female with vesicoureteral reflux 
and several prior episodes of pyelonephritis who presented with 
flank pain and high fevers similar to her previous episodes of 
pyelonephritis.

# Pyelonephritis: She presented with flank pain, fevers, and 
positive urinalysis concerning for pyelonephritis.  On 
admission, she met ___ SIRS criteria and had a likely urinary 
source of infection, meeting the definition of sepsis.  Her 
initial lactate was normal, and she was hemodynamically stable 
with improved tachycardia after IV fluids and consistently 
normal blood pressures.  She presented with a dramatic WBC# of 
23K, with left shift, but no bandemia, down to 11K on day of 
discharge. Her Renal ultrasound was reassuringly normal without 
signs of perinephric abscess.  She did remain febrile for ~36 
hours, which raised concern for treatment failure with 
Ceftriaxone.  There was concern she may have a resistant 
organism, so she was instead treated with Cefepime after 
admission to the floor.  She received Acetaminophen, Oxycodone, 
and Ondansetron for symptom control.  Urine cultures eventually 
grew pan sensitive E coli, and she was discharged on a course of 
Ciprofloxacin.  Given her recurrent severe urinary tract 
infections, followup with Urology was arranged to discuss her 
options to prevent future infections.  Her blood cultures were 
all negative.  
.
# Constipation: She had not had a bowel movement in several days 
and was started on a fairly aggressive bowel regimen with 
Colace, Senna, Miralax, and Bisacodyl.
.
# Cold Sore: On the day of discharge, she noted a cold sore on 
her lower lip.  She reported having them fairly frequently and 
asked for something to treat it, so was provided topical 
Acyclovir ointment.
.
# Transitional Care:
-- Discharged on a course of Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO Q12H for 7 
more days
-- Arranged new PCP appointment at ___ since she does not have a 
PCP in the area
-- Arranged initial visit with Urology to discuss possible VUR 
treatment options
-- If no surgical options to treat VUR, consider prophylactic 
antibiotics

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___ 
___.  You were admitted for a kidney 
infection (pyelonephritis) with high fevers and flank pain.  You 
were given IV fluids and treated with IV antibiotics during your 
stay.  Urine cultures grew a type of bacteria called E coli, 
which was sensitive to all of the antibiotics tested.  Your 
fevers improved, and you were switched to oral antibiotics to 
take after discharge.  You will need to complete an additional 
one week course of these antibiotics after discharge.

Because you do not have a primary care doctor in the area, you 
were scheduled for an initial visit with a new primary care 
doctor in the Healthcare ___ clinic at ___.  Because of 
your frequent urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis, you 
were also scheduled to see a urologist after discharge.

 
Followup Instructions:
___
