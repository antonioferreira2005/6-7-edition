Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the gyn/onc service as a transfer 
from ___ with a small bowel obstruction and plan for 
interstitial implant on ___. Prior to her transfer, patient 
spent two nights at ___ for her ___ where she was managed 
conservatively with NPO status and IV fluids.

Upon arrival to the floor, patient had no nausea or vomiting. 
She was tolerating clears and had a benign exam.

Regarding her small bowel obstruction:

Patient was continued on clears on ___. However, she started 
feeling nauseous throughout the day. Overnight she had an 
episode of emesis. Exam at the time was notable for a soft, 
mildly distended abdomen with one  right inferior hernia and one 
periumbilical hernia that was mildly tender to palpation. She 
was thus switched to NPO.

On ___ (HD#3), given continued nausea, a CT abdomen and pelvis 
was obtained. This demonstrated two transition points within the 
inferior ventral hernia defect, con concerning for a closed loop 
obstruction.  There was additional loculated fluid along the 
mesentery within the hernia concerning for bowel ischemia, noted 
to be suboptimally evaluated on noncontrast CT. Given these 
findings, an  NGT was placed for bowel rest/decompression. 
Further work up for question of bowel ischemia on imaging was 
deferred as her abdominal exam was stable and her vital signs 
were stable.  She continued to be managed conservatively and 
began passing  flatus and having dropped NGT output on ___ 
(HD#6). On ___, she had decreased NGT output and minimal 
residual  after a clamp trial. Thus her NGT was removed and her 
diet was slowly advanced on ___ (HD#7). That day, she was seen 
by acute care surgery  (ACS) who determined that the patient was 
not currently a surgical candidate but that she may follow up 
with ACS as an outpatient. She also had multiple episodes of 
diarrhea and one well formed stool later that afternoon. On 
___, she was tolerating a regular diet. Sh e continued to pass 
flatus and had a normal  abdominal exam with stable vitals. She  
was discharged home in stable condition with plan for close 
follow up with interstitial implants.

Regarding her tachycardia:
During her hospital stay, patient was triggered on ___ for 
tachycardia in the 150s while the patient was sleeping. She was 
asymptomatic at the time. An EKG demonstrated atrioventricular 
normal sinus tachycardia. For this patient was treated with 
adenosine. Cardiology was contacted who suggested obtaining an 
echo to assess for structural causes of tachycardia. Lytes, 
lactate, TSH were within normal limits at the time (___). The 
echo on ___ was normal, showing some mild pulmonary 
hypertension. Throughout her hospital stay, patient was noted to 
have non sustained tachycardia with stable O2 saturation, BPs.  
Patient was told to follow up in four weeks with outpatient 
cardiology per  ___ cardiology recommendation. 

Regarding her home medications:. Throughout her hospital stay, 
Ms ___ was prescribed for her home medications, which 
include asthma inhalers. medication for asthma, as well as 
medications for hyperlipedemia and hypertension.
