Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypotension/Pneumonia: Patient was admitted to the ICU with 
tachycardia, fever, and hypotension which was felt most likely 
from acute pneumonia given cough, pleuritis, and opacities on 
CXR.  Pt was covered with Vancomycin/Levofloxacin due to her 
history of MRSA PNA.  She was aggressively fluid resuscitated 
and supported with pressors with resolution of hypotension.  Pt 
did not require ventilator support and later had significant  
autodiuresis of large volumes of urine and BP remained stable 
off pressors.   She was called out to the floor with resolution 
of fevers.  Additional infectious work up included multiple 
negative Urine & Blood Cx, an echo that did not show any 
vegetations, negative HIV viral load, negative Viral Influenza 
screen and negative Legionella Antigen. Leukocytosis continued 
to resolve on Linezolid with high dose Levofloxacin.   Pt was 
continued on Linezolid for an ___nd pre-authorization 
was obtained for po Linezolid on discharge to sober house.  
Levofloxacin was transitioned to Moxifloxacin to complete the ___ue to insurance approval requirements.
.
# Abnomal LFTs: Pt reports intermittent RUQ pain and initial u/s 
showed small amount of ascites though not enough for 
paracentesis and LFTs revealed a mildly elevated transaminases 
with mild Alk Phos elevation.  Hepatitis panel was sent and 
returned positive for Hep C Ab though Hep C VL was negative.  
Hep B studies revealed prior immunization and repeated RUQ u/s 
was performed prior to discharge which showed small periportal 
lymphadenopathy.  These results were discussed with the patient 
and she was given an appointment to follow up with the liver 
clinic for further investigation. 
.
# Narcotic addiction:  Pt was continued on Methadone at 
confirmed clinic doses but had an epsiode of somnolence in the 
ICU thought due to multidrug interaction.  There was concern 
raised for in hospital drug abuse though repeat urine drug 
screen returned positive for opiates (on Methadone) and 
barbituates (on Fioricet) without any unexplained positive 
substances on the screen.  Given this concern, all visitors were 
screened prior to visits.  After being transitioned to medical 
floor, pt was restarted on her home medication regimen including 
Clonidine, Clonazepam and Methadone with mild intermittent 
somnolence though no acute episodes of confusion.  It was 
suggested that this regimen may be overmedicating her and pt 
felt that it was necessary to treat her anxiety and withdrawal.  
She was discharged with plan for PCP and ___ clinic follow 
up but was not given any refills on these medications.
.
# Vulvovaginitis: Pt reported symptoms of vaginal 
itching/burning consistent with prior yeast infections.  
Symptoms were only somewhat relieved with fluconazole/miconazole 
cream.  Pt endorsed some concern of possible exposure to an STI 
prior to admission and pelvic exam was performed on ___ that 
was significant for vulvar irritation most likely c/w ___.  
Cervical swabs were sent for gonorrhea/chlamydia but were 
pending at the time of this dictation.  We will follow up on the 
final results.  Pt was discharged with a course of miconazole 
and acidophilus per her request.

have improved significantly on antibiotics.  You will need to 
continue taking antibiotics for another 2 days to complete the 8 
day course.  You were also reporting intermittent epigastric 
pain and underwent a RUQ ultrasound which showed some fluid and 
mildly enlarged lymph nodes around the liver.  This will need to 
be followed up and you have been scheduled to see the liver 
specialist, please keep this appointment as shown below.  
.
You were reporting some vulvovaginitis and underwent pelvic exam 
that was most consistent with yeast candidiasis.  You have 
received two days of fluconazole and you have been given a
