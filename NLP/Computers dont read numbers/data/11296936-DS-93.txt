Chief Complaint:
chest pain, shortness of breath
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Dialysis on ___ and ___
 
History of Present Illness:
___ yo M with h/o DM II c/b ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation not 
on coumadin, recently admitted for chest pain and hypoxia, 
presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath.  Patient 
reports that since discharge, he has seen his PCP, ___, 
___ was feeling relatively well.  He notes that the night prior 
to admission, he had the acute onset of shortness of breath, 
with heart palpitations and chest pain ___ on left, radiating 
down his left arm.  He had had frequent episodes since discharge 
but none as intense.  He reports that coughing makes the pain 
worse, nothing makes it better.  It is constant.  

He believes the coughing is a representation of having too much 
fluid.  Patient reports that prior to onset of shortness of 
breath and chest pain, he had been at dialysis where 5L fluid 
were removed (more than usual).  After dialysis, he could barely 
walk because of extreme right calf pain, which he describes as a 
stretching/swelling sensation.  

Patient reports that he has not used cocaine in "several weeks." 
 He believes the last time was prior to his last admission, at 
least 1.5 weeks ago.  His partner, ___, believes this to be 
true as well, though she can not be entirely sure. 

In the ED, initial vital signs were ___ 18 94% RA. 
Patient triggered for atrial fibrillation with RVR to the 150s. 
Patient was given 30mg oral diltiazem with rats down to ___. He 
also received morphine for chest pain and aspirin 325mg.  Given 
complaints of RLE pain, ___ was performed.  Preliminary read 
was negative for DVT.  

On admission, initial vital signs were 97.8 145/79 90 28 100% 3L 
NC.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with a h/o cocaine abuse, ESRD on HD, afib with RVR, 
with frequent admissions for SOB/chest pain presenting with 
SOB/chest pain.

# Chest pain- Persistent through hospital course, with 
improvement in standing tylenol and PRN oxycodone.  Likely due 
to persistent cough: pleuritic vs musculoskeletal 
(costochondritis) from straining muscles to cough.  Initially, 
possibly related to demand ischemia in setting of atrial 
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Trigger for rapid 
response appears to be volume overload, as CXR shows worsening 
pulmonary edema. Also may be that atrial fibrillation has caused 
flash pulmonary edema to occur.  Troponins elevated, but likely 
related to ESRD, not higher than his baseline, and CKMB flat, so 
low suspicious for acute coronary syndrome.  Patient has not 
used cocaine recently per his report (2 weeks ago), but given 
history, may be intermittent vasospasm.  Last catheterization 
was in ___ and did not show any coronary artery disease.  Low 
suspicion for pulmonary embolism and preliminary ___ read 
negative for DVT.  We avoided NSAIDs given history of GI bleed.  
We provided nitroglycerin SL prn chest pain.  

# Pulmonary edema by exam (elevated JVP, basilar crackles), and 
CXR with worsening edema.  Dry weight 67kg, now 70.5kg, at 
discharge was 63.2kg.  Patient was weaned off the nasal canula 
and fluid restricted to 1200cc

# Atrial fibrillation with RVR- CHADS 2 of 3.  Not 
anticoagulated due to previous GI bleeds.  On ER diltiazem 420mg 
po daily and digoxin with dialysis. Patient has had digoxin 
dosing altered as was high during previous admission.  Atrial 
fibrillation may have been triggered by volume status (or caused 
worsening pulmonary edema), or may be due to changing dose of 
digoxin and patient is now subtherapeutic: 0.7.  Patient was 
given PO diltiazem 90mg QID for titration.  On the final full 
day in house following dialysis, patient had HRs in the 150s 
(had missed 2 doses of diltiazem while in dialysis) and was 
given an extra 10mg IV diltiazem and was increased to 105mg QID. 
 Patient also had 1 9 beat run of NSVT which was asymptomatic 
but seen on telemetry.  Beta blockers were not used for 
hypothetical reaction with cocaine use.

# ESRD- On HD ___.  5L removed during ___ dialysis.  
4L on ___ and an unclear amount on ___, although 
patient's CXR improved and he was down below his previous dry 
weight at 63.2kg at discharge.  We continued sevelamer, 
nephrocaps, and cinacalcet

# DMII- We continued home lantus with humalog sliding scale and 
diabetic diet.  QACHS ___ were in the mid ___ range, occasionally 
in the 200s and corresponding to patient eating snacks.  We 
encouraged patient not to snack during night.

# Diabetic neuropathy-  We continue gabapentin 100mg po TID
  
# Rash on chest: From previous notes: "Likely acneiform cysts.  
One option would be doxycycline that he can take twice daily.  I 
would like to start him on 100 mg twice daily.  He can continue 
using his selenium sulfide wash, and if this does not work there 
is also the option of starting Accutane."  Patient was itching 
on back, although there was no evidence of nodular eruptions on 
the back.  Bilirubin was normal.  Unclear what was the 
precipitant.  We monitored and patient was given Sarna lotion at 
d/c.

# Transitional issues-
- Dialysis per renal team: ___
- Patient discharged with standing tylenol for chest pain which 
is most likely costochondritis.
