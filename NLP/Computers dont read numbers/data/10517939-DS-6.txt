for which he went to a ___ who improved his symptoms. 
About 3 days prior he began having fevers up to 101 (per son).

Reports
ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately 
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical 
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus 
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic 
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis 
appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and 
transvalvular gradients. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The left 
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No vegetations seen

Neck CT:
IMPRESSION:  
1. No fluid collection, inflammatory change or lymphadenopathy.  

2. Dilated distal ascending aorta, 4.3 cm; aortic arch not 
imaged. Recommend CTA chest to evaluate, if not already 
performed elsewhere. 
3. Atherosclerosis at left ICA origin with possible moderate 
stenosis, not adequately quantified as this is not a CTA. If 
clinically indicated, this could be assessed by carotid 
sonography. 
4. Multilevel cervical spondylosis; please correlate whether 
this may be the source of the patient's pain. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old genteman with h/o aortic stenosis s/p bovine valve 
replacement in ___ presenting with fever to 38.7 C and 
generalized myalgias x4 days. During hospitalization, patient 
was found to have parasite smear for anaplasma.  Patient was 
discharged home on 14 day course of doxycycline to treat both 
anaplasma and empirically for lyme disease as coinfection is 
common.  

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Fevers: Given h/o aortic valve replacement endocarditis was 
considered as a possibility, but TTE did not show this.  
Serologies were sent for tick borne illness as pt spent 
significant time outdoors.  Cultures did not reveal infection.  
No evidence of pneumonia on CXR. Pt had neck CT to evaluate for 
abscess/neck infection given his neck mucsle pain (no meningeal 
signs), but this did not show signs of infection. Patient's 
parasite smear showed anaplasma and he was discharged on 14 day 
course of doxycycline to treat both anaplasma and empirically 
for lyme disease as coinfection is common. 

___: Cr is 1.7 up from 1.3 in ___. Likely prerenal in the 
setting of fevers (insensible losses).  On admission patient 
received 1L IVF bolus and creatinine improved to baseline. 
 
#Thrombocytopenia- 120 from 185. Decreased to ___ at discharge.  
Likely secondary to anaplasma infection.  Recommended patient 
have CBC rechecked at PCP's office this week. 
  
INACTIVE ISSUES:
#Aortic Stenosis: Stable. 
  
#Hypertension: Continued verapamil, aspirin 162 mg daily, 
doxazosin 1 mg daily 
 
#Hyperlipidemia: Continued statin  

#Depression: Continued effexor  

#Insomnia: Continued ambien    

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Pt with CT scan showing dilated ascending aorta.  Consider CTA 
as outpatiet to further evaluate.  This was communicated with 
the patient and his son and they will follow-up with his 
PCP/cardiologist to discuss further.  (ECHO showed mild 
dilitation of aortic root).  
- Pt needs CBC rechecked at PCP's office this week. 
- Lyme, sporothrix, anaplasma, arbovirus serologies pending at 
discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

You were admitted for fevers, leg pain, and neck pain.  We
