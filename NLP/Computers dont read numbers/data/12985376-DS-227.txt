Cardiac catherization ___
COMMENTS:      
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
revealed 3 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was normal. 
The LAD had 80% diffuse in-stent restenosis followed by a 95% 
stenosis just beyond the stent. The distal LAD had a 99% 
stenosis. D1 had a 60% stenosis, and D2 was occluded with 
filling from left to left collaterals. The LCX had a 60% 
proximal stenosis. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis, 70% mid 
stenosis, and 70% distal stenosis. The PDA was occluded, and 
filled via left to right collaterals. 
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated right sided 
filling pressures with a RVEDP of 18mm Hg, and mildly elevated 
left sided filling pressures with a LVEDP of 25mm Hg. Systemic 
arterial pressures were normal. The SVR was normal at 13.1 Wood 
units. The PVR was normal at 1.7 Wood units. 
3. Left ventriculography revealed a globally hypokinetic 
ventricle, with
an ejection fraction of 25%. There was no mitral regurgitation. 
There was no transaortic valvular gradient on careful pullback 
of the catheter from the ventricle to the aorta. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction with an ejection 
fraction of 
25%. 
3. Moderate to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
.
EKG on admission ___: 
NSR at vent rate of 99. Unchanged old Q waves in anterior leads. 
Isolated 1mm ST elevation in aVF. Otherwise similar to prior 
dated ___

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___SRD on HD ___, 
gastroparesis, autonomic dysfunction, CAD (STEMI, NSTEMI), s/p 
cardiac catherization on ___, who presents with his usual 
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain that began the morning of 
presentation. 
.
# N/V/abdominal pain: These symptoms were essentially identical 
to his usual gastroparesis symptoms. LFTs were WNL. Lipase was 
slightly elevated however was not outside his previous range. IV 
Ativan and Dilaudid were helpful for symptom relief and he was 
able to tolerate regular diet starting the night of Hospital Day 
2. IV Reglan, Compazine and Zofran were also made available for 
the patient. His IV medications were switched to PO equivalents 
and the patient was discharged home with PO reglan, dilaudid and 
ativan for pain/nausea control and prevention of future 
episodes. 
.
# ESRD on HD: Patient underwent his regularly scheduled HD 
sessions (___) while hospitalized through the left 
tunnelled femoral HD line. He was continued on Lanthanum, 
Nephrocaps as per home regimen. Nephrology consulted the patient 
in the ED and followed the patient in-house.
.
# Elevated Troponin: The patient was 3 days post-cardiac 
catherization. Patient has a history of high troponins likely 
due to persistent troponin leakage in the setting of decreased 
clearance due to ESRD. Pt's troponin of 0.5 on admission 
increased to 0.83 the next day, which is more elevated that his 
usual range. However CK remained flat between 200 and 300, with 
negative CK-MB index. Cardiology service was aware of the 
patient's elevated tropnonin. They recommended continuing 
medical treatment as ACS was thought to be unlikely with flat 
CKs, normal CK-MB index, and in the absence of EKG changes and 
chest pain. Pt was continued on ___, statin, BBker and 
Lisinopril per home regimen. 
- The cardiac catherization on ___ showed 3-vessel disease. 
Patient has a Cardiology appointment with Dr. ___ on ___ to 
discuss further treatment options such as CABG. Dr. ___ will 
see him as inpatient if the patient is in-house at that time and 
misses the appointment. (***HOUSE STAFF: PLEASE LET ___. ___ 
___ IF THIS HAPPENS SO THAT HE IS AWARE***) 
.
# DM: Blood sugar was poorly controlled during hospitalization 
due to pt's inconsistent dietary intake. He was continued on 
home dosing NPH and a gentle sliding scale. The patient was 
discharged with his previous regimen of 5 Units NPH QAM and 
regular insulin sliding scale. 
.
# HTN: BP was well controlled during this hospitalization 
(mostly 100s-120s systolic, with occasional spikes into 150s). 
Home medications were continued. 
.
# Access: pre-existing left tunnelled femoral line for 
hemodialysis; right femoral venous catheter placed in ED for IV 
therapy and blood draws, d/c'd at discharge.
