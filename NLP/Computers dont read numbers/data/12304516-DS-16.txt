Brief Hospital Course:
# CP: On arrival to floor was chest pain free and remained cp 
free throughout admission. Somewhat concerning for ACS given DM, 
obesity, hyperlipidemia, however chronicity of chest discomfort 
(years) and high exercise tolerance are reassuring. Other 
possible etiologies include anxiety, musculoskeletal, gerd, 
esophageal spasm. no ekg findings to suggest pericarditis. No 
sinus tach or desaturation to suggest PE. Pt ruled out for MI 
and monitored on telemetry without event. She cannot get ETT ___ 
vertigo on treadmill. It was felt that she was not high risk and 
did not need inpt stress test, an outpatient stress echo could 
be considered. Pt's aspirin was continued. She has not been 
taking statin ___ concerns about LFTs however, we checked them 
and they were normal so she says she will now take statin at 
home. Cholesterol panel was checked and LDL was in 160s (above 
goal).

meclizine, which provides some relief.
