Pertinent Results:
___ TEE
Conclusions   
 There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional 
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size is normal with normal free wall contractility. The 
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal 
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque . There is severe 
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <1.0cm2). No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 
 Post bypass
 The aortic valve is well seated with no paravalvular 
regurgitation.The biventricular function is normal The thoracic 
aorta is intact.The rest of the exm is unchanged   
.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent AVR (25mm ___ tissue) with Dr. 
___.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  
 POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.  
He did demonstrate delirium in the immediate post-op days.  
Zyprexa was added for agitation with good effect.  Narcotics 
discontinued. Neurology consulted.  Head CT negative.  Symptoms 
resolved and he returned to his baseline neuro status prior to 
discharge. 
 Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed 
toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to 
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and 
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The 
patient was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service for 
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge 
on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was 
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The 
patient was discharged home in good condition with appropriate 
follow up instructions.
