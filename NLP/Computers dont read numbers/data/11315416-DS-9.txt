___ year old woman with history of dementia, osteoporosis, lower 
extremity edema who presents with fatigue and acute kidney 
injury.  

#Acute Kidney Injury: Likely pre renal azotemia secondary to 
decreased PO intake and over diuresis, s/p 500cc in ED with 
improvement in Cr. On admission with Cr of 1.9, improved to 1.4 
with fluids. No prior laboratory data to determine baseline Cr. 
Diuretics and meloxicam were held during admission, plan to hold 
on discharge. 

#Fatigue: Likely secondary to poor PO intake and dehydration. 
TSH wnl. No evidence of infection with normal CBC, UA, and CXR. 
No anemia. No symptoms of CP, dyspnea on exertion, or ECG 
changes to suggest cardiac etiology. ___ evaluated patient with 
recommendation for home ___ services  

#Lower extremity edema: Patient with evidence of chronic venous 
stasis on exam. No known history of heart failure but was on 
moderate doses of Lasix and metolozone for lower extremity 
edema. Diuretics held during admission and discharge. Unable to 
reach PCP (office closed) to determine prior workup of lower 
extremity edema  

 CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES:  
 #Dementia: Home Namenda xr as short acting 5mg BID  
 #Osteoporosis: Vitamin D1000 IU daily, hold NSAIDs with ___, 
acetaminophen as needed for pain  
 #Cardiovascular: Unclear why patient is on full dose aspirin.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] Consider reduction of ASA 325 to 81 mg if indicated
[ ] Hold diuretics on discharge. Would recommend low salt diet, 
compression stockings. If recurrent edema, consider resuming 
furosemide at 40-60 mg PO without metolazone.  
[ ] Repeat chem 7 to monitor continued improvement of creatinine
[ ] Should have TTE to evaluate for diastolic heart failure as 
etiology of lower extremity edema unless recently completed 
[ ] Meloxicam discontinued on discharge
[ ] Discharged with home ___ services
