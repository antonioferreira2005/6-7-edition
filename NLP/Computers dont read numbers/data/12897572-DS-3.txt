History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 
This is a ___ y/o male with esophageal adenocarcinoma amidst 
radiation treatment. Patient was scheduled to receive portacath 
and G-tube placement this ___ with Dr. ___, 
___ was admitted to ___ on ___ with confusion, found 
to be hypoglycemic after taking 40 units of an unidentified type 
of insulin. On presentation to ___, the patient was febrile 
to 100.4 and tachycardic to the 120's. He was given 1L of IV 
fluids and his HR fell to the 70's. CXR revealed possible LLL 
infiltrate from presumed aspiration during the patient's 
hypoglycemic episode. He was given Vanc/Zosyn for empiric 
treatment of aspiration pneumonitis, and given the patient's 
reports of pleuritic chest pain, a CTA was performed and read as 
(-) for PE. His confusion resolved with resolution of his 
hypoglycemia.
.
Of note, the patient's wife reports his inability to eat over 
the past few weeks. He has only been taking liquids by mouth and 
usually is very "dehydrated looking."
.
In ___/urine culture/blood culture were all negative.

___ for hopefully expedited PEG placement.

STUDIES & IMAGING:
CXR (PORT) ___: In comparison to study of ___, there is 
some increased opacification in the retrocardiac area. Although 
this could well reflect atelectasis and possible small effusion, 
in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would 
have to be considered. The right lung is clear and there is no 
pulmonary vascular congestion.
.
CXR (PORT) ___: Evaluation of the patient with esophageal 
cancer 
after PEG placement with diffuse abdominal pain, evaluate for 
perforation. AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in 
comparison to ___. Heart size is top normal. 
Mediastinum is unremarkable. The right central venous line tip 
is at the level of mid SVC. There is left basal linear opacity, 
most likely representing atelectasis, unchanged since the prior 
study, associated with small amount of pleural effusion. No 
definitive free intra-abdominal air is noted on the current 
study, but correlation with dedicated upright radiograph or 
decubitus view is highly recommended. No pneumothorax is seen.
.
KUB (PORT) ___: Two AP views of the abdomen in the supine 
and upright positions show a nonspecific bowel gas pattern with 
no intraperitoneal free air. A PEG tube is seen projecting off 
the left side of the patient, but the insertion point cannot be 
visualized. IMPRESSION: No evidence of perforation or 
intraperitoneal free air.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is the brief hospital course for an ___ year old male with 
gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who recently finished 
an aggressive chemotherapy and radiation regimen who was 
transferred from ___ for fever and dysphagia who hospital 
course included PEG and port placement as well as pneumonia 
covereage.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# FEVER: Attributed to PNA. Other infectious causes including 
urine, stool, and blood were considered and ruled out. Pt was 
ruled out for C.diff given complaints of diarrhea. He last 
spiked a fever on ___. Patient will be treated for 10 days of 
cefpodoximine. His last dose will be ___. At discharge blood 
cultures from ___ are still pending. Please call ___ 
for results.
.
# TACHYCARDIA: Patient was noted to be in sinus tachycardia to 
110-120s. Initially it was thought to be ___ dehydration and 
fevers. Pain and agitation were also considered and treated 
according. Patient was not hypoxic so PE was thought to be less 
likely. Metoprolol was initially reduced given infection and was 
then retitrated to 37.5mg BID with good response to heart rate.
.
# ADENOCARCINOMA of GE JUNCTION: Patient was essentially 
transferred to ___ to expedite PEG and PORT placement. Patient 
has post operative pain in abdomen. Abdominal and Chest plain 
films were obtained did not show any acute intra-abdominal 
pathology, other than increased stool in lumen. Patient was 
started on an aggressive bowel regimen which resolved abdominal 
pain. Patient ultimately to receive chemotherapy if functional 
status improves. 
.
# PARTICIPATION IN CARE: Patient has a very stubborn 
disposition. He was initially very resistant to go to rehab 
despite recommendations from the medical team. However with 
strong encouragement from family he became amenable. He will 
likely require more encouragement while in rehab. 
.
# DIABETES: After starting tube feeds, patient's fingersticks 
were elevated to 300s. Patient will need further titration of 
insulin to better control diabetes
.
# HYPERTENSION: Patient was initially normotensive while on 
antihypertnesives however then had one epsiode of hypotension 
while in the hospital requiring fluid bolus. Antihypertensives 
were then down titrated however on discharge BP was 150/90. He 
will need further titration of medications while at rehab.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, you were admitted to the ICU for a hypoglycemic 
episode. After this resolved, you were transferred to the 
oncology service for evaluation of your malnutrition and 
difficulty swallowing.
.
During the course of your admission, you had several physical 
exam findings which were concerning for infection. One of these 
was fever. Everytime you spiked a fever, you were cultured by 
blood, urine, stool, and even sputum once. All cultures were 
negative to date. X-rays of your chest and belly were also done. 
One chest x-ray indicated a possible pneumonia which was located 
behind your heart on one side, but since you declined further 
imaging, we were left treating the infection blindly without 
knowing its exact cause. Your last day of antibiotics will be on 
___.  Thankfully, your fevers trended downward on the 
antibiotic we chose for you. The other findings were your fast 
heart rate and low blood pressure. Sometimes people who are 
volume down will have vital signs like this, but even after 
giving you fluids in an IV, your vitals remained irregular. 
Hopefully, as you become stronger and we titrate your 
medications closer to the levels you were taking at home this 
will resolve.

You had a PEG placement for nutrition and a port placement for 
future chemotherapy. 

You appeared very weak and need rehab before going home. 

Good luck with your recovery
