History of Present Illness:
___ yo gentleman with a long-standing history of metastatic 
melanoma, s/p multiple resections and treatments, recently on an 
experimental ctx protocol who presents from home with complaints 
of high fevers. Initially, after receiving the experimental 
medication, he developed a full body rash and reports "his skin 
was hot to the touch." The rash started on ___ and he stopped 
the medication for several days.  He then resumed the medication 
at a lower dose. The rash resolved. He denies any associated

started empirically on cefepime for neutropenic fever (WBC 1.3 
65 percent neutrophils). UA negative, CXR without evidence of 
focal PNA, LFTs were noted to be uptrending. He was then

Past Oncologic History:
Mr. ___ was diagnosed with a 1.45 mm thick,
___ level IV melanoma from his lower back in ___.  He
underwent wide local excision and bilateral inguinal negative
sentinel lymph node biopsies. He developed left inguinal
recurrence in ___, undergoing completion left inguinal lymph
node dissection on ___ with pathology revealing melanoma
in four of nine nodes with extracapsular extension.  He received
radiation therapy to the left inguinal region completing in
___.  He began interferon off protocol in ___ with
therapy discontinued on ___ due to radiation colitis.  In
___, he underwent biopsy of a right clavicular lesion by Dr.
___ a 0.45 mm thick, ___ level III melanoma.  He
underwent wide local excision in ___.  In ___, he had
biopsy of a left mandible skin lesion revealing a ___ level
III, 0.51 mm thick melanoma with three mitoses per mm2.  On
___, he underwent wide local excision and sentinel lymph
node biopsy by Dr. ___ with no residual 
melanoma
at the primary site, but one of three lymph nodes showed a
microscopic deposit of melanoma.  He underwent modified left 
neck
dissection on ___ with no melanoma noted in seven
additional nodes.  In ___, he underwent biopsy of a new
right chest wall skin lesion by Dr. ___ metastatic
melanoma not seen at the margin without an epidermal component
and two mitoses per mm2.  It was unclear whether this 
represented
an in-tranist metastasis from his right clavicle melanoma or an
epidermatrophic metastasis. He underwent right chest wide local
excision and right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy by Dr.
___ on ___.  There was no evidence of residual
melanoma in the chest or in the sentinel lymph node.  Staging
scans were negative and he began GM-CSF off protocol on
___, completing 13 cycles in ___. Torso CT in
___ revealed new small bilateral pulmonary nodules and an
abnormal right kidney. CT guided biopsy of the right kidney on
___ confirmed metastatic melanoma. He began the Phase I/II

protocol, with fatigue, fevers at home to 103, neutropenia, ___, 
LFT abnormalities, and fevers in hospital to 100.8. 

# Neutropenic fevers: the patient reported having fevers for 2 
days prior to admission.  We started him on zosyn IV for broad 
gram negative coverage including pseudomonas.  The patient had 
no clear signs of infection on exam, had a negative UA, a 
negative CXR, and a negative CT chest/abdomen/pelvis.  The 
patient's WBC count decreased from 1.3 to 1.0 in under 24 hours 
(ANC 854 to 640).  He was also pancytopenic.  After discussing 
with the patient's oncology team, we administered a single dose 
of neupogen. We continued to monitor vitals and CBC levels 
closely.  His ANC elevated to 1200 on hospital day 2.  He also 
had 2 documented fevers to 100.8F. Since his ANC elevated, the 
patient was feeling better, and has very good follow up plan, he 
was discharge to home.  He was instructed to take his 
temperatures q8h at home and after any chills.  Blood cultures 
were pending upon discharge.  He will follow up at his local 
hospital in ___ to check a CBC on ___ and the 
results will be sent to the ___.  Depending on the CBC 
results, he will receive a dose of neupogen as needed.  

# Acute renal failure: Creatinine levels were elevated at 1.3 
from baseline normal. After administration of IV fluids, 
creatinine normalized indicating volume depletion likely from 
decreased po intake.  His creatinine levels increased on HD 2 
and we administered IV fluids before discharge and instructed 
him to remain hydrated at home. 

# Elevated LFTs: the increase was moderate, yet new. According 
to his experimental chemotherapy study team, elevated LFTs are 
not a common side effect of this medication.  There was no 
change in appearance of the liver on CT abdomen compared to 
previous imaging. We felt that this elevation was secondary to 
the medication since his LFTs appeared to be trending up after 
initiation of this treatment. We monitored his LFTs daily and 
held the medication during his stay. 
 
# Metastatic melanoma: the patient is currently on an 
experimental chemotherapy protocol. We discussed his care with 
his oncology team.  As above, he received one dose of neupogen 
for neutropenia that was likely due to the experimental 
medication.  His oncology team will follow up with him next 
week.  

# Oral thrush: the patient had white plaque on his gingiva. It 
was unlikely to be systemic. We treated him with nystatin oral 
rinse. 

# Pain control: we continued administering his outpatient 
regimen. The patient did not require additional dosing. 

# Anxiety: we continued administering his home medication 
lorazepam for sleep.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were hospitalized because you had fevers up to ___.  With 
your medical history, you are at risk for becoming ill with 
fevers from infections. We ran several tests to look for an 
infection since you did not have any symptoms or signs to 
indicate a clear source. These tests included a chest x-ray, 
blood studies, and a CT study to image your chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis.  
Your chest x-ray, CT scan, and urine tests did not show any sign 
of infection.  The blood test results were still not final when 
you were discharged.  Throughout this time, we made sure to give 
you IV antibiotics. You did not have a fever while you were in 
the hospital and were feeling well.  We also saw that you were 
dehydrated and gave you IV fluids. It is likely that your fever 
may be due to the drugs.
.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IF YOU HAVE A FEVER>101 please call your 
oncologist.

We also found that your blood tests were low and liver tests 
were slightly high.  After speaking with your oncology team, we 
thought that these changes might be caused by the experimental 
medication you have been taking.  You had not taken this 
medicine since ___.  

Since your blood levels started to go down, we gave you a dose 
of medication that works to increase blood levels.  

You also had oral thrush, a type of yeast infection of the 
mouth, so we gave you a medicated mouth rinse to treat this. 

During this hospitalization, we made some changes to your 
medications:
) STOPPED Plexicon, your current treatment. Your oncology team 
will decide to restart or stop this medication after you leave 
the hospital.  

We continued to give you the medications you take at home for 
pain and sleep.    

We recommend that you follow up with your oncology team to 
discuss this hospitalization and further treatment. There are 
appointments that have been made for you. 
 
Followup Instructions:
